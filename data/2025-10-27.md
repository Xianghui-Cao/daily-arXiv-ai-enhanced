### [1] [Gaussian Processes for Inferring Parton Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21041)
*Yamil Cahuana Medrano,Hervé Dutrieux,Joseph Karpie,Kostas Orginos,Savvas Zafeiropoulos*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework for the reconstruction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice QCD data, which is an ill-posed inverse problem. The method uses Bayesian inference to provide flexible priors, uncertainty quantification, and robust results without strong functional form assumptions. It is validated through synthetic data tests, and it is proposed as a systematic approach with controlled uncertainties and less model bias.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges associated with the extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or lattice QCD data, which is known to be an ill-posed inverse problem. The authors aim to improve the reliability and reduce the systematic uncertainties of PDF reconstructions by proposing a new method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).

Method: The authors employ a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework within a Bayesian context to reconstruct PDFs. They use GPR as a non-parametric and flexible prior that encodes uncertainties and correlations, while avoiding the imposition of rigid functional forms. The study also explores various kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. Additionally, they utilize the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the information gained from the data.

Result: Through synthetic data tests, the authors demonstrate that their GPR-based method is consistent and robust. The results show that the GPR approach can provide a systematic and non-parametric way to reconstruct PDFs, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and reduced model bias in the context of lattice QCD analyses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a promising and systematic approach for the reconstruction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice QCD data. It offers several advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to handle uncertainties and correlations flexibly, without being constrained by specific functional forms, and it provides more reliable and less biased results.

Abstract: The extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or
lattice QCD data is an ill-posed inverse problem, where regularization strongly
impacts both systematic uncertainties and the reliability of the results. We
study a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct
PDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian
processes serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and
constraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide
range of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We
quantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler
divergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of
the method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric
approach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and
reduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses.

### [2] [Composite objects in quantum (super)gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21248)
*Axel Maas,Simon Plätzer,Felix Pressler*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the idea of self-bound gravitons, or geons, as a dark matter candidate or (primordial) black holes using causal dynamical triangulations. The results show an interesting time dependence and other features, and the study is extended to a supergravity scenario, suggesting potential reasons for the non-observability of supersymmetry at low energy scales.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the long-held concept that self-bound gravitons, known as geons, could serve as a dark matter candidate or form primordial black holes, now made possible by the development of viable quantum gravity candidates.

Method: The method involves an analytic approach showing the need for composite operators based on the graviton field, followed by a numerical investigation using causal dynamical triangulations, which is an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity. The research also extends to include a supergravity setting.

Result: Results from the numerical simulations suggest a notable dependence on cosmological time and reveal other unexpected characteristics. The extension to a supergravity framework provides insights into why supersymmetry might not be detectable at lower (collider) energy levels in a realistic universe.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that the study of geons through causal dynamical triangulations yields new insights into their behavior over cosmological time and hints at the possible reasons for the non-observability of supersymmetry at low energies, opening up further avenues for research.

Abstract: It has been a long entertained idea that self-bound gravitons, so-called
geons, could be a dark matter candidate or form (primordial) black holes. The
development of viable candidates for quantum gravity allows now to investigate
these ideas. Analytic methods show that the description of geons needs to be
based on composite operators made out of the graviton field. We present results
from a numerical investigation into this idea using causal dynamical
triangulations, an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity
based on general relativity, and accessible in lattice-gauge-theory-like
simulations. Our results suggest an interesting dependence on cosmological time
and other unexpected features. Finally, we extend the analytic part of the
setting to a supergravity scenario. This provides hints which, if confirmed,
could explain why supersymmetry may in a realistic universe in principle not be
observable at low (collider) energy scales.
