### [1] [Using lattice chiral effective theory to study pi-pi scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15187)
*Cameron Cianci,Luchang Jin,Joshua Swaim*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study compares the finite-volume energy spectrum of the $\pi\pi$ system using lattice field theory in $SU(2)$ ChEFT with lattice QCD, finding significant differences, especially a nearly stable $\sigma$ resonance in ChEFT not present in QCD, suggesting poor convergence of ChEFT with lattice regularization.

Motivation: To investigate the convergence and validity of $SU(2)$ chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) as compared to lattice QCD when applied to the finite-volume energy spectrum of the $\pi\pi$ system, particularly focusing on the isospin $I=0$ channel.

Method: Lattice field theory is utilized to calculate the finite-volume energy spectrum of the $\pi\pi$ system within $SU(2)$ ChEFT at leading order. The results are then compared with those obtained from a lattice QCD calculation, both performed under the same conditions, including physical pion mass and volume.

Result: Significant discrepancies are observed between the ChEFT and lattice QCD calculations, notably the presence of a nearly stable $\sigma$ resonance in the ChEFT calculation that is absent in the lattice QCD data, indicating issues with the convergence of ChEFT using a naive lattice regularization scheme.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that $SU(2)$ ChEFT may not converge well when regularized on a lattice, as evidenced by the appearance of a $\sigma$ resonance in the ChEFT spectrum, which is not found in the corresponding lattice QCD spectrum.

Abstract: We use lattice field theory to study the finite-volume energy spectrum of the
$\pi\pi$ system in $SU(2)$ chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) at leading
order in the chiral expansion. We compare our results with the finite volume
spectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512,
2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD
calculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same
physical volume. However, we find significant differences between the two
calculations in the isospin $I=0$ channel. In particular, there is a nearly
stable $\sigma$ resonance in our lattice ChEFT calculation, which is absent in
the lattice QCD calculation. This likely indicates that ChEFT does not converge
well with a naive lattice regularization.

### [2] [The Truncated Hankel Correlator Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15500)
*Johann Ostmeyer,Carsten Urbach*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new method, the Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC), is introduced for approximating Euclidean correlation functions using exponential sums. The THC method can reproduce a variety of algebraic correlator analysis methods and allows for weighted data analysis, making it similar to a closed-form solution for multi-state fits. It is robust against noise, requires little human oversight, and guarantees symmetric energy spectra for symmetric input data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient and versatile method for approximating Euclidean correlation functions that can handle a wide range of data, including matrix-valued correlators, and provide a close to optimal chi-squared value, while being robust to noise and requiring minimal human intervention.

Method: The Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC) method constructs a Hankel matrix from the full set of correlator data and then truncates the eigenspectrum of this matrix. The Prony generalized eigenvalue method is subsequently applied to the low-rank approximation obtained. The THC method also allows for the inclusion of weights, such as inverse square errors, in the analysis.

Result: The THC method is shown to be a general approach that encompasses many existing algebraic correlator analysis methods, including block Prony, block Lanczos, and the generalized eigenvalue problem, as sub-optimal special cases. Additionally, the method is demonstrated to be robust to noise, require less human oversight, and ensure symmetric energy spectra when dealing with symmetric data.

Conclusion: The THC method provides a powerful and flexible tool for approximating Euclidean correlation functions, offering improvements over existing methods in terms of optimality, robustness to noise, and ease of use. It is particularly well-suited for multi-state fits and the analysis of matrix-valued correlators.

Abstract: We introduce a new method to approximate Euclidean correlation functions by
exponential sums. The Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC) method builds a Hankel
matrix from the full correlator data available and truncates the eigenspectrum
of said Hankel matrix. It proceeds by applying the Prony generalised eigenvalue
method to the thus obtained low-rank approximation. A large number of algebraic
correlator analysis methods including (block) Prony (and equivalently (block)
Lanczos) and the generalised eigenvalue problem (GEVP) can be reproduced as
sub-optimal special cases of the THC method. Weights, for instance inverse
square errors, can be included in the analysis, so that the result has a close
to optimal $\chi^2$-value. This makes the THC method very similar in spirit to
a closed form solution to multi-state fits, naturally including the case of
matrix-valued correlators. We show that, in general, finding approximations
better than those provided by the THC method is exponentially hard in the
number of exponentials. Moreover, the THC method is robust against noise and
requires comparably little human oversight. Finally, when applied to symmetric
data, the obtained energy spectrum is guaranteed to be symmetric up to machine
precision.
