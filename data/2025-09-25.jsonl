Traditional compactifications at finite temperature\nwithout rotations typically involve ${\\mathbb T}^4$ as the space-time manifold\nwithin a path integral formulation and also moving frames can be accommodated\nby shifted boundary conditions on the same space. We show that consistent\ndescriptions of a rotating box are possible on space-time manifolds with\ntopology different from ${\\mathbb T}^4$ but still flat and without boundary and\nwe classify all possible geometries. The non-trivial topology may be\nimplemented by rotated boundary conditions allowing for a path integral\nformulation. The purely imaginary angular velocity in temperature units cannot\nbe arbitrary but several discrete values are possible. We also discuss finite\nvolume effects in detail."}
