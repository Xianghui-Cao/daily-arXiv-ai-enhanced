Grebe", "Issaku Kanamori", "C. -J. David Lin", "Robert J. Perry", "Yong Zhao"], "title": "Parton physics from a heavy-quark operator product expansion: Lattice QCD calculation of the fourth moment of the pion distribution amplitude", "comment": "19 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential\nnon-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in\nquantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of\nthe fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using\nquark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\\pi = 550$ MeV. This\ncalculation finds $\\langle\\xi^2\\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\\langle \\xi^4\n\\rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined\nstatistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second\nindicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to\nnext-to-leading order. These results are presented in the\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\\mu = 2$ GeV."}

One of these lattice charges satisfies the Onsager algebra.\nOn the lattice, the charges $Q_F$ do not commute with $Q_0$, and no symmetric\nmass term exists that commutes with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$. This signals the\npresence of a mixed anomaly. Remarkably, however, in the continuum limit, a\nsymmetric mass term commuting with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$ can be constructed. %\nThis implies that the non-trivial lattice anomaly becomes a trivial anomaly in\nthe continuum QFT. This means that the mixed anomaly that is nontrivial on the\nlattice becomes trivial in the IR QFT obtained in the continuum limit, which is\nconsistent with the analysis of the Ward--Takahashi (WT) identity on the\nlattice. Indeed, by evaluating this identity associated with the\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ transformation on the lattice, we confirm that\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ symmetry is exactly conserved."}
