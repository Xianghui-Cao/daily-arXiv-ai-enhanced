In this work, we investigate score-based\nsymmetry-preserving diffusion models as an alternative strategy to sample\ntwo-dimensional $\\phi^4$ and ${\\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories. We develop\nscore networks that are equivariant to a range of group transformations,\nincluding global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflections, local ${\\rm U}(1)$ rotations, and\nperiodic translations $\\mathbb{T}$. The score networks are trained using an\naugmented training scheme, which significantly improves sample quality in the\nsimulated field theories. We also demonstrate empirically that our\nsymmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks in sample quality,\nexpressivity, and effective sample size."}

Nucleon interactions are fundamental to how the\nuniverse developed after the Big Bang and govern all nuclear phenomena. The\nsubtle balance in how two nucleons interact shapes the universe's hydrogen\ncontent that is central to our existence. Our objective is to compute the\ninteraction strength while varying the parameters of nature to understand how\ndelicate this balance is. We developed a new code using sophisticated physics\nalgorithms and a highly optimized library for simulations on CPU-GPU parallel\narchitectures. It has excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling for\na fixed problem size with increasing number of nodes up to El Capitan's full\n$\\sim$11,000 nodes.

Guenther", "Piyush Kumar", "Paolo Parotto", "Attila Pásztor", "Chik Him Wong"], "title": "Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations", "comment": "12 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density\nis a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations.\nThrough simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ we observe\nthat, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness\nchemical potential $\\mu_S/\\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\\chi_2^S$\ntake on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\\mu_B$. We\npresent new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\\mu_S/\\mu_B$ or\n$\\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good\nproxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly\ninfluenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum\nlimits for these proxies up to $\\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on\nlarge-statistics data on $16^3 \\times 8$, $20^3 \\times 10$ and $24^3 \\times 12$\nlattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in\nexcellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and,\nstrikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas\n(HRG) model. On the $16^3 \\times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the\nextrapolation beyond $\\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the\nHRG model.

Green"], "title": "Position-space sampling for local multiquark operators in lattice QCD using distillation and the importance of tetraquark operators for $T_{cc}(3875)^+$", "comment": "16 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Obtaining hadronic two-point functions is a central step in spectroscopy\ncalculations in lattice QCD. This requires solving the Dirac equation\nrepeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method\naddresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial\nLaplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully\ninverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson\nand baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or\nmore (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of\ncontractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors.\nWe present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces\nthis cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids\nrather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this\nunbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark\noperators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point,\nwe apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for\nthe finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large\nbasis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local\ntetraquark operators. The inclusion of local operators leads to significant\nshifts in several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on\nthe $DD^*$ scattering phase shift from a single-channel $s$-wave L\\\"uscher\nanalysis."}

The architecture uses\nphysics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the\nlayerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple\nfirst order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation\ngroup kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task\ninto that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential\nequations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are\nanalytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to\nstructurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative\nmodels and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical\nfeasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories."}
