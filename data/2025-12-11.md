Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in controlling the range of validity for usual extrapolations in baryon chemical potential (μ_B) when studying finite density lattice QCD. The authors aim to use a canonical formulation where the baryon density, not μ_B, is the parameter of the system.

Method: The method involves high-statistics simulations using 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions to compute the QCD pressure and chemical potentials as functions of baryon (n_B) and strangeness (n_S) densities.

Result: The researchers present first results with both the strangeness (n_S) and baryon (n_B) densities as parameters, showing that it is possible to access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by using the canonical formulation, the study can effectively access finite density QCD, providing a new approach to calculate QCD pressure and chemical potentials based on baryon and strangeness densities rather than relying on extrapolations in baryon chemical potential.

Abstract: Finite density lattice QCD usually relies on extrapolations in baryon chemical potential ($μ_B$), be it Taylor expansion, T' expansion (\cite{Borsanyi:2021sxv}) or analytical continuation. However, their range of validity is difficult to control. In the canonical formulation, the baryon density is the parameter of the system, not $μ_B$. Here we demonstrate that we can access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses. We present first results with both the strangeness ($n_S$) and baryon ($n_B$) densities as parameters. Specifically, we compute the QCD pressure and chemical potentials as functions of $n_B$ and $n_S$. Our computations rely on high-statistics simulations with 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions.

### [2] [Lattice determination of the QCD low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09880)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-perturbative determination of the low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ using lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 quark flavors, resulting in an improved and more precise value compared to previous determinations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more accurate and reliable value for the low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$, which is important for the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian at next-to-leading order, by using lattice QCD simulations that allow for controlled extrapolations to the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits.

Method: The method involves lattice QCD simulations with staggered fermions and the extraction of $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting. The authors used 12 gauge ensembles with varying pion masses and lattice spacings to perform controlled extrapolations to the physical point.

Result: The final result is $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \times 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm stat}}(26)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm tot}}$, which is in agreement with but more precise than previous determinations of this constant.

Conclusion: The study concludes with a more accurate and precise determination of the low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ through the use of lattice QCD, providing a significant improvement over prior results.

Abstract: We provide a non-perturbative determination of the scheme- and scale-independent low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$, appearing in the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian at next-to-leading order, by means of lattice QCD simulations with $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}=2+1$ quark flavors. We adopt staggered fermions and extract $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting by suitably generalizing the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 074513] for the Wilson discretization. Adopting 12 gauge ensembles with 3 different values of the pion mass, and 4 different values of the lattice spacing, we are able to achieve controlled extrapolations towards the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits. Our final result $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \,\times \, 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm stat}}(26)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm tot}}$ agrees with and substantially improves on previous determinations.
