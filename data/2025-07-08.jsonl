The proposed solver first establishes the relationships\nbetween the macroscopic governing equations and mesoscopic formal equations\nthat describe the temperature, flow, and phase fields. The macroscopic\ngoverning equations are then discretized by the finite volume method (FVM),\nwith the corresponding fluxes calculated based on the established\nrelationships. In this way, it enables a unified and coherent solution\nframework for all fields. In contrast to the conventional lattice Boltzmann\nmethods, the present approach handles additional terms directly via finite\nvolume discretization, offering a more straightforward and flexible\nformulation. Furthermore, the use of the total enthalpy equation to couple the\ntemperature field with the phase fraction allows for efficient modeling of\nphase change processes, significantly reducing the computational complexity\nassociated with interface tracking. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nsolver are demonstrated by a series of benchmark tests, including the\nconductive freezing problem, the three-phase Stefan problem, the freezing of a\nliquid film in a two-dimensional container, the solidification of a static\ndroplet on a cold surface, and the freezing of a droplet upon impact with a\ncold surface."}
