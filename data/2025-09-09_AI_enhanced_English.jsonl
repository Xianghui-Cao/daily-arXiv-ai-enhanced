We completely\ncharacterize the CSE in QCD using $2+1$ simulations of staggered quarks tuned\nat the physical point. We find that the CSE conductivity is severely suppressed\nat low temperatures, and experiences a very sharp increase around the QCD\ncrossover transition, reaching the value of massless non-interacting fermions\nat high temperatures. This is the first non-perturbative calculation of an\nanomalous transport conductivity in physical QCD. In the case of the CME, we\nshow that this effect is not present in thermal equilibrium, in accordance with\nBloch's theorem, both for free fermions and in QCD. We emphasize the crucial\nrole of using a conserved vector current in the study of anomalous transport\nphenomena on the lattice, and how the use of non-conserved currents is behind\nnon-vanishing results for the CME in equilibrium that can be found in the\nliterature. Finally, we study the interplay between the CME and inhomogeneous\nmagnetic fields, which leads us to find a novel localized CME signal in\nequilibrium. This does not contradict Bloch's theorem, since the total signal\naverages to zero when summed over the full volume. This effect is present in\nphysical QCD, showing that a local equilibrium CME signal is possible in the\npresence of gluonic interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) and Chiral Separation Effect (CSE) through lattice QCD simulations, revealing that CSE conductivity is highly suppressed at low temperatures but sharply increases around the QCD crossover. The CME is found to be absent in thermal equilibrium, with a novel localized CME signal observed in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of anomalous transport phenomena, specifically the CME and CSE, within the framework of QCD using non-perturbative methods, such as lattice QCD simulations, and to resolve discrepancies in the literature regarding the CME's presence in thermal equilibrium.", "method": "Lattice QCD simulations with $2+1$ flavors of staggered quarks at the physical point were used to characterize the CSE. For the CME, the study involved demonstrating its absence in thermal equilibrium for both free fermions and in QCD, while also investigating the effect of inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the CME.", "result": "The CSE conductivity was found to be severely suppressed at low temperatures and increased sharply near the QCD crossover transition. The CME was shown not to occur in thermal equilibrium, consistent with Bloch's theorem, but a localized CME signal was observed in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields, which does not violate the theorem when averaged over the entire volume.", "conclusion": "The research provides the first non-perturbative calculation of an anomalous transport conductivity in physical QCD, highlighting the importance of using conserved currents in lattice studies. It also clarifies the conditions under which a local CME signal can be present, even in thermal equilibrium, when there are inhomogeneous magnetic fields and gluonic interactions."}}
