Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires \"moderate\" parameter tuning."}

The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles, generated by the MILC collaboration, with two complementary setups for the valence charm action, one using the HISQ action and the other using the overlap fermion action. Our prediction for the mass of the lowest two triply charmed spin-3/2 baryons are: $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{+}) = 4793 (5) \\left(^{+11}_{-8}\\right)$ MeV, and $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{-}) = 5094 (12) \\left(^{+19}_{-17}\\right)$ MeV."}

Sánchez"], "title": "Pion scattering at finite volume within the Inverse Amplitude Method", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the effect of a finite volume for pion-pion scattering within Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) in a $L^3$ box (rest frame). Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_πL \\lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy."}

With a moderate numerical cost, our method allows to estimate spectral functions with parametrically better frequency resolution as compared with spectral reconstruction methods based on Euclidean-time correlators alone. The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime."}
