TL;DR: The paper presents a study on baryonic flux tubes in (2+1) dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, measuring the baryon-junction mass and testing the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture with good agreement to theoretical predictions.

Motivation: The motivation is to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass using high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, and to test the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions, especially in the high-temperature regime near the deconfinement transition.

Method: The method involves high-precision lattice simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator to isolate the 1/R^2 correction term that is proportional to the baryon-junction mass. The researchers also compare their results with the predictions from conformal perturbation theory applied to the two-dimensional three-state Potts model at high temperatures.

Result: The result is the measurement of the baryon-junction mass M/sqrt(Ïƒ) = 0.1355(36), which is similar to the value used in hadron phenomenology. Additionally, there is excellent agreement between the lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators and the predictions from the two-dimensional three-state Potts model, supporting the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the measured baryon-junction mass is consistent with phenomenological expectations and that the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture is supported by the comparison of lattice data with the conformal perturbation theory results, particularly in the high-temperature region just below the deconfinement transition.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills
theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within
the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit
the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order
$1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the
possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of
this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov
loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By
isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the
value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which
is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature
behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture
for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature
regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results
for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by
applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two
dimension, and find excellent agreement.
