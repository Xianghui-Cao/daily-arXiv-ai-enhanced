By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $\u03bb_\\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory on a lattice, exploring how confinement and topological order vary with parameters N, g, and k.

This finding suggests that the continuum limit of the large-N gauge theory may be more intricate than initially thought, indicating the need for studies that go beyond mean-field approximations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the topological order in (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory remains stable at large N, pointing to a more nuanced continuum limit.
