TL;DR: The paper investigates S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD, with results indicating overall attraction but no dibaryon bound state. It also examines the charm quark mass dependence of the potential and compares findings with previous studies.

Motivation: To study the interaction dynamics between a nucleon (N) and a triply charmed Omega baryon (立ccc) in order to understand the nature of the potential, particularly whether it leads to the formation of a dibaryon bound state, and to investigate the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability.

Method: Utilizing (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass on a specific lattice volume, implementing the charm quark with a relativistic heavy-quark action, and employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method to extract N-立ccc potentials in spin-1 and spin-2 channels. The potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components for analysis.

Result: The research found overall attraction in both spin-1 and spin-2 channels without evidence of a dibaryon bound state. Scattering parameters were quantified, and the potential was characterized by a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, with spin-dependent contributions showing attraction or repulsion depending on the channel. Charm quark mass effects on the potential were also explored.

Conclusion: The N-立ccc system exhibits an overall attractive interaction in both the spin-1 and spin-2 channels, with the spin-independent potential being the dominant feature. No dibaryon bound state is formed, and the study highlights the importance of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability. The charm quark mass dependence of the potential provides additional insights into the interaction mechanisms.

Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply
charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD
with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume
$\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a
relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the
time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in
the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are
extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering
parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and
$r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the
$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} =
2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel,
indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are
further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The
spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range
attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent
potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2)
channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and
$N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided,
emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from
soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm
quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated
as well.
