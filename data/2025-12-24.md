*Orlando Oliveira,Paulo J Silva*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for scale setting in lattice QCD simulations, which efficiently addresses finite size effects and links the simulations to continuum perturbation theory, applicable to other Green functions as well.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the accuracy of physical predictions from lattice QCD simulations by developing an efficient method for scale setting that also accounts for finite size effects in the ultraviolet regime.

Method: The authors use the Landau gauge gluon propagator with large statistical ensembles to set relative scales for different β values. They then observe and manage finite size effects through an effective description inspired by perturbation theory.

Result: The new procedure effectively handles finite size effects and connects lattice simulations to continuum perturbation theory in the high momenta regime. It can be applied to other Green functions within lattice QCD simulations.

Conclusion: The devised scale-setting procedure is concluded to be an efficient approach for dealing with finite size effects and linking lattice QCD results to theoretical predictions, with potential applicability to a broader range of computations.

Abstract: A crucial step in extracting physical predictions from lattice QCD simulations is the scale setting, i.e. the determination of the lattice spacing ($a$) in physical units. Herein, the relative scale setting for different $β$'s is discussed, using the Landau gauge gluon propagator computed with large statistical ensembles. After setting the relative scales, finite size effects are observed in the ultraviolet regime and handled in an effective description, inspired in perturbation theory. The new devised procedure is efficient in handling the finite size effects, linking the lattice simulations with continuum perturbation theory for the high momenta regime. Furthermore, the procedure can be extended to handle other Green functions computed within lattice QCD simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of ensemble generation in lattice field theory simulations by leveraging recent advances in generative modeling, specifically aiming to accelerate sampling processes with diffusion models.

Method: The authors implement a new method for training diffusion models that are adapted to work with SU(N) group manifold, using an adjusted score matching technique to efficiently train these models on the specific degrees of freedom relevant to lattice field theories.

Result: The results show that the trained diffusion models can effectively replicate several target densities and generate accurate, unbiased expectation values, indicating their capability to model complex systems such as full SU(N) lattice field theories, including Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed framework for training diffusion models on SU(N) degrees of freedom has the potential to significantly advance the field of lattice field theory simulations, particularly in the context of QCD, by providing a more efficient and accurate method for ensemble generation.

Abstract: Although ensemble generation remains a central challenge in lattice field theory simulations, recent advances in generative modeling may offer a path to accelerated sampling in these contexts. In this work, we implement a framework for efficiently training diffusion models acting on ${\rm SU}(N)$ degrees of freedom, adapting the traditional score matching technique to the group manifold. We demonstrate that our models can effectively reproduce several target densities, resulting in precise unbiased expectation values. These results mark a step for diffusion models towards modeling full ${\rm SU}(N)$ lattice field theories, including lattice Quantum Chromodynamics.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel learning method for recovering action parameters in lattice field theories, based on Schwinger-Dyson relations, which is shown to be a generalization of score matching and applicable to gauge theories and models with Grassmann-valued fields, including quantum chromodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to develop a more effective and broadly applicable method for recovering action parameters in lattice field theories, particularly one that can handle the complexities of gauge theories and dynamical fermions represented by Grassmann-valued fields.

Method: The authors introduce a learning method grounded in the minimization of a convex loss function, which is derived from the Schwinger-Dyson relations. They demonstrate that their approach generalizes the concept of score matching and can be applied to an infinite family of valid loss functions, making it suitable for a wider range of theories, such as those involving gauge symmetries and fermionic degrees of freedom.

Result: The results show that the new method not only recovers known techniques like score matching as a special case but also extends to more complex and realistic lattice field theories, including the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the proposed learning method offers a versatile and powerful framework for parameter recovery in lattice field theories, with the potential to significantly impact the study of gauge theories and models with dynamical fermions, such as QCD.

Abstract: We introduce a learning method for recovering action parameters in lattice field theories. Our method is based on the minimization of a convex loss function constructed using the Schwinger-Dyson relations. We show that score matching, a popular learning method, is a special case of our construction of an infinite family of valid loss functions. Importantly, our general Schwinger-Dyson-based construction applies to gauge theories and models with Grassmann-valued fields used to represent dynamical fermions. In particular, we extend our method to realistic lattice field theories including quantum chromodynamics.

Systematic chiral and continuum extrapolations are also performed to achieve the final results.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study successfully calculates the charmed baryon decay constants from first principles with a specified precision, providing a valuable reference for future theoretical and experimental studies on charmed baryons.

Abstract: We present the first principle calculation of charmed baryon decay constants employing 2+1 flavor gauge ensembles with lattice spacings ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 fm and pion masses between 136 and 310 MeV. Under $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, we construct the charmed baryon interpolating operators and compute the corresponding hadronic matrix elements to extract the bare decay constants for each ensemble. The non-perturbative renormalization is performed via the symmetric momentum-subtraction scheme. After performing systematic chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the decay constants with a precision of $8\sim 16\%$ from first principles.
