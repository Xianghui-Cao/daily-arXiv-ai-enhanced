Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \\ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews the current understanding of the QCD phase diagram through various theoretical approaches, focusing on recent advancements in lattice techniques that have enabled exploration of new aspects. It discusses the reconstruction of the full phase diagram for physical QCD and comments on the implications for neutron star cores and the chiral transition in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide an updated review of the QCD phase diagram, incorporating recent technical advances in lattice techniques, and to discuss how this knowledge can be applied to understand the full phase diagram for physical QCD with $N_f=1+1+1$.", "method": "The method involves a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge from lattice calculations, effective field theories, and chiral models. It also evaluates the impact of recent lattice technique improvements on the ability to explore new sections of the QCD phase diagram.", "result": "The result is a detailed discussion of the known sections of the QCD phase diagram for $N_f=2+1$ flavors, the potential for reconstructing the phase diagram for physical QCD, and the current constraints on matter in neutron star cores. Additionally, it provides insights into the physics of the chiral transition and its relevance to neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.", "conclusion": "The conclusion suggests that while significant progress has been made in understanding the QCD phase diagram, further computations are needed to fully elucidate the phase structure for physical QCD, particularly in relation to the composition of neutron star cores and the behavior at the chiral transition."}}
