The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations."}

This work extends previous gluon-PDF extractions by performing a detailed analysis of key systematic effects, including gauge-link smearing, lattice spacing, pion mass, and nucleon boost momentum. The self-renormalization framework mitigates ultraviolet divergences associated with Wilson-line self-energy and renormalon contributions by combining lattice matrix elements with perturbative short-distance information, thereby preserving the correct infrared structure. Calculations are performed on $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three lattice spacings and two pion masses, with boosted nucleon states reaching momenta up to 2.2~GeV. We determine renormalization factors from zero-momentum matrix elements and apply hybrid renormalization to suppress discretization artifacts. After extrapolating large-separation behavior and performing Fourier transforms, we reconstruct quasi-PDFs and match them to lightcone PDFs using next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. Our results demonstrate that smearing and lattice-spacing effects are under control, and pion-mass and lattice-spacing dependence is mild relative to the current $O(10^6)$ statistics; however, momentum dependence remains a significant source of uncertainty. Future work including even larger boost momenta will be essential to reduce systematics in lattice determinations of the gluon PDF and to advance toward precision QCD phenomenology at the LHC and the future Electron-Ion Collider."}
