We focus on operators that do\nnot mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation\nproperties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\\Delta F =\n2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same\nirreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial\nsubset of $\\Delta F = 1$ and $\\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis\nprovides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their\nFierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants\nof GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing\noperators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing\neffects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper provides a detailed analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, focusing on their renormalization in a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). It classifies these operators, examines their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns, and offers conversion matrices to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme for selected GIRS variants.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a comprehensive study of four-quark operators that do not mix with lower-dimensional operators, due to their specific transformation properties under the flavor-symmetry group. This includes $\\Delta F = 2$ operators and related $\\Delta F = 1$ and $\\Delta F = 0$ operators, which are significant in particle physics.", "method": "The authors use a theoretical approach to classify and analyze the four-quark operators, taking into account their renormalization within various versions of the Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). They also derive conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order for certain GIRS variants.", "result": "The result is a thorough classification of the four-quark operators, along with an exploration of their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. The study also presents conversion matrices that allow for the transition between different renormalization schemes, specifically from GIRS to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme, for selected cases where mixing effects are minimized.", "conclusion": "The conclusion would be that the paper successfully provides a detailed framework for understanding the renormalization of four-quark operators within the context of GIRS, offering valuable insights into their classification and the relationship between different renormalization schemes."}}
