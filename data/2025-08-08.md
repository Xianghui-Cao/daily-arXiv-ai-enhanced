TL;DR: This paper presents a first-principles, non-perturbative determination of the meson mass spectrum and low-energy constants in large-N QCD. The authors use numerical Monte Carlo simulations with large-N twisted volume reduction to explore the 't Hooft limit, and they examine sub-leading 1/N corrections by comparing their results with previous finite-N studies.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a better understanding of the large-N QCD in the 't Hooft limit and to investigate the behavior of radial Regge trajectories for certain mesons. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate the magnitude of sub-leading 1/N corrections to QCD low-energy constants.

Method: The method involves using large-N twisted volume reduction to conduct efficient numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice discretized theory. The research uses several values of N (up to 841), multiple lattice spacings, and different quark masses to ensure reliable continuum and chiral extrapolations.

Result: The results include determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum, the quark condensate, the pion decay constant, and the next-to-leading-order coupling. The authors also investigate the radial Regge trajectories and assess the size of 1/N sub-leading corrections.

Conclusion: The conclusion would summarize the findings regarding the meson mass spectrum and the low-energy constants, as well as the insights gained on the radial Regge trajectories and the 1/N sub-leading corrections, providing a clearer picture of the large-N QCD in the 't Hooft limit.

Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying
meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit
$N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy
constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$,
the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling
$\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$
channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge
trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the
magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$
results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits
large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo
simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several
values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several
values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral
extrapolations.

### [2] [Gradient and Hessian-Based Temperature Estimator in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Diagnostic Tool for Stability and Consistency in Numerical Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05595)

TL;DR: A novel temperature estimator for lattice gauge theories, based on field configurations and geometric entropy, is developed. It proves to be an accurate and robust tool for assessing thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations, with broad applicability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a reliable, gauge-invariant, non-kinetic method for estimating the temperature in lattice gauge theory simulations, which can be used as a diagnostic for thermodynamic consistency across various conditions and theories.

Method: The method involves constructing a temperature estimator from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action, inspired by geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics. The estimator's performance is validated through Monte Carlo simulations in compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in 1D, 2D, and 4D, comparing the estimated temperatures with the known input temperatures.

Result: The results show that the temperature estimator accurately reproduces the input temperatures and maintains its accuracy over a range of lattice volumes and coupling strengths, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: The temperature estimator provides a general-purpose, gauge-invariant, and non-kinetic means to ensure thermodynamic consistency in lattice field theory simulations. It has potential applications in non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time monitoring during hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.

Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge
theories. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean
action of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in
classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant,
non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations
of lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge
theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated
temperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator
accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range
of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a
general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential
applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time
monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.
