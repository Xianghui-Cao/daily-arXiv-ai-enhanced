### [1] [Configurational Thermometer for Lattice Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17436)
*Vamika Longia,Navdeep Singh Dhindsa,Anosh Joseph*

Main category: hep-lat

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a diagnostic tool that can directly check thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories without relying on momentum-space information.

Method: The method involves creating an estimator from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action, which is both gauge invariant and configuration-based, and applying it to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories across different dimensions.

Result: The results show that the estimator can reproduce the correct input temperatures for different lattice ensembles and is also sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, proving its utility as a diagnostic tool.

Conclusion: The proposed temperature estimator is effective for confirming thermodynamic consistency and diagnosing potential problems in lattice gauge theory simulations, making it a valuable asset for large-scale simulations.

Abstract: We propose a diagnostic tool, a temperature estimator, for lattice gauge theory simulations. The estimator is obtained from the gradient and the Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action. It is gauge invariant, configuration-based, and independent of momentum-space information. These features enable direct checks of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this tool to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. The results confirm the proposed estimator's ability to reproduce the input temperatures across different lattice ensembles. The estimator is sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, making it a useful diagnostic for large-scale simulations.

### [2] [Lattice determination of the neutrino background for $J/ψ\rightarrow γ+ \textrm{invisible}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18209)
*Yu Meng,Ning Li,Chuan Liu,Haobo Yan,Ke-Long Zhang,Xue-Ze Zhang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/ψ\to γν\barν$, which is an important background for dark matter searches. The calculated branching fraction is $1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, providing a benchmark for future experiments and theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a precise determination of the neutrino background from the decay $J/ψ\to γν\barν$ as it is an irreducible background for dark matter searches through invisible decays of heavy quarkonia, such as $J/ψ\to γ+ \textrm{invisible}$. With improved experimental upper limits and upcoming facilities, having a reliable background estimate is crucial for these searches.

Method: The method employed is a lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculation, which is a non-perturbative approach used to determine the properties of subatomic particles. The authors have performed the first ab initio calculation of the decay $J/ψ\to γν\barν$ using this method, providing both statistical and systematic uncertainties in their result.

Result: The key result is the branching fraction of the decay $J/ψ\to γν\barν$, which is found to be $\operatorname{Br}(J/ψ\to γν\barν)=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$. This value includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties, and it serves as a benchmark for the neutrino background in searches for dark matter via invisible decays of the $J/ψ$ meson.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the lattice QCD calculation provides a robust theoretical prediction for the $J/ψ\to γν\barν$ decay, which is essential for subtracting the neutrino background in dark matter searches. The work also establishes a generalizable method for calculating similar backgrounds in other quarkonium channels, thus supporting future collider-based dark matter searches.

Abstract: Searching for dark matter is a primary goal of modern astronomy and particle physics. Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/ψ$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/ψ\to γν\barν$, an irreducible background to $J/ψ\to γ+ \textrm{invisible}$. Our result for the branching fraction is $\operatorname{Br}(J/ψ\to γν\barν)=1.00(9)(7)\times 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is our systematic estimate. This work advances lattice-based determinations of neutrino backgrounds to quarkonium invisible decays, delivering an ab initio benchmark for $J/ψ\to γ+ \textrm{invisible}$. Our approach generalizes to other quarkonium channels (e.g., $Υ/φ\to γ+\textrm{invisible}$) and provides critical theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders.

### [3] [Chiral Properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-Flavor QCD in Magnetic Fields at Zero Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18354)
*Heng-Tong Ding,Dan Zhang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A lattice QCD study of chiral properties in (2+1)-flavor QCD under magnetic fields, with physical pion masses. The study shows that chiral condensates increase with the field strength, neutral pseudoscalar meson masses decrease, and charged ones show a non-monotonic response. Neutral meson decay constants are enhanced, and valence quark effects dominate the magnetic response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields, and to quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations in the presence of a magnetic field.

Method: The researchers used lattice QCD simulations with the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action at four different lattice spacings for a controlled continuum extrapolation. They computed renormalized chiral condensates, pseudoscalar meson masses, and decay constants as functions of the magnetic field strength.

Result: Chiral condensates exhibit magnetic catalysis, increasing with the magnetic field strength. Neutral pseudoscalar meson masses decrease, while charged mesons display a non-monotonic behavior. Decay constants of neutral pseudoscalars are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. Valence quark contributions are found to dominate the magnetic response in meson masses.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into how QCD's chiral symmetry breaking is affected by strong magnetic fields, showing that valence quarks play a significant role in the magnetic response, and that the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relation experiences varying degrees of deviation for neutral pions and kaons.

Abstract: We present a lattice QCD study of the chiral properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor QCD in background magnetic fields at zero temperature with physical pion masses. Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $η^0_{s\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\simeq1.2$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields.

### [4] [Formal Naive Dirac Operators and Graph Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18576)
*G. M. von Hippel*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between zero modes of formal Dirac operators on certain graphs and the Betti numbers of the underlying spacetime manifold, confirming and strengthening a conjecture by Misumi and Yumoto for graphs with commutative translations. It also provides interpretations using graph quotients and abelian group representation theory, and links to a homology theory for these graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate a recent conjecture by Misumi and Yumoto, which suggests a connection between the number of zero modes of lattice Dirac operators and the sum of the Betti numbers of the spacetime manifold.

Method: The authors study formal Dirac operators on a specific class of graphs, focusing on those where translations commute. They use techniques from graph theory, representation theory of abelian groups, and homology theory to analyze the zero modes and their relation to the Betti numbers.

Result: The main result is that for graphs with commutative translations, not only can the conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto be confirmed, but it can also be enhanced to provide bounds on individual Betti numbers rather than just their sum. The paper also offers interpretations of the zero modes in terms of graph quotients and abelian group representations, and draws connections to a homology theory for such graphs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the conjecture holds true for the studied class of graphs and provides additional insights into the topological properties of the graphs through the analysis of zero modes and their relations to Betti numbers and homology.

Abstract: Motivated by a recent conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto relating the number of zero modes of lattice Dirac operators to the sum of the Betti numbers of the underlying spacetime manifold, we study formal Dirac operators on a class of graphs admitting such in terms of their zero modes. Our main result is that for graphs on which translations commute, the conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto can be shown and indeed can be strengthened to obtain bounds on the individual Betti numbers rather than merely on their sum. Interpretations of the zero modes in terms of graph quotients and of the representation theory of abelian groups are given, and connections with a homology theory for such graphs are highlighted.
