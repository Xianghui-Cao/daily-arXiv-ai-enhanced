Proceedings of the 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025), TIFR Mumbai, India, 2025", "summary": "The $U(1)_A$ symmetry of the massless QCD Lagrangian is explicitly broken in the quantised theory by the anomaly. It may be effectively restored at some finite temperature, which would have important consequences for the order of the chiral transition and the QCD phase diagram. It has been argued in the literature that one way to probe the effective restoration of $U(1)_A$ is to check for the degeneracy of pseudoscalar and flavour non-singlet scalar correlators. In this work, we consider a new method of examining this degeneracy based upon hadron correlation functions on the anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles. The anisotropic nature and our newest Generation 3 ensembles aid in a determination of the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry which we find to be $T_{U(1)_A} \\sim 320$ MeV, well above the chiral transition temperature, which is $T_{\\rm pc} \\sim 180$ MeV for our choice of Wilson-Clover fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the effective restoration of $U(1)_A$ symmetry in QCD at finite temperature, finding it to be restored at approximately 320 MeV, which is above the chiral transition temperature of about 180 MeV, using a new method based on hadron correlation functions on anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles.", "motivation": "The motivation for this research is to probe the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry, which is broken by the anomaly in quantized QCD, as it could have significant implications for the order of the chiral transition and the QCD phase diagram. The authors propose a new method to examine the degeneracy of pseudoscalar and flavour non-singlet scalar correlators as a way to investigate this restoration.", "method": "The authors use hadron correlation functions on the anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles, with a particular emphasis on their Generation 3 ensembles, to test for the degeneracy of pseudoscalar and flavour non-singlet scalar correlators, which is indicative of the effective restoration of $U(1)_A$ symmetry. The anisotropic lattices and improved ensembles are used to achieve a more accurate determination of the restoration temperature.", "result": "The study finds that the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry occurs at a temperature of around 320 MeV, which is significantly higher than the chiral transition temperature of approximately 180 MeV for the Wilson-Clover fermions used in the simulations. This result suggests a clear separation between the chiral transition and the restoration of axial symmetry.", "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper is that the $U(1)_A$ symmetry is effectively restored at a temperature much higher than the chiral transition temperature, indicating that these two phenomena are distinct and occur at different temperatures within the QCD phase diagram. The findings support the idea that the degeneracy of certain correlators can be used to probe the restoration of $U(1)_A$ symmetry."}}
