Contribution to the the XVIth Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum Conference (QCHSC24) 19-24 August, 2024 Cairns Convention Centre, Cairns, Queensland, Australia", "summary": "At large momentum transfer, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the form factor of the pion $F_\u03c0(Q^2)$ using lattice QCD simulations. Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_\u03c0(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_\u03c0(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_\u03c0(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link. Costs in terms of qubit and gate number, and circuit depth, are found.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the use of the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation for simulating 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer, which reduces the number of qubits needed. It also introduces an oracle algorithm to check and maintain the local constraints during the simulation.", "motivation": "The motivation is to efficiently simulate non-Abelian gauge theories, specifically SU(3), on a quantum computer while maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics, and to address the issue of constraint violation due to noise during time evolution.", "method": "The authors employ the LSH formulation to map the SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto a smaller set of qubits compared to the IRREP basis. They also develop an oracle algorithm to check the local constraints at each link, which helps in keeping the state within the correct sector of the Hilbert space.", "result": "The LSH formulation leads to a significant reduction in the number of qubits required for the simulation. The oracle algorithm is designed with specific costs in terms of qubit and gate numbers, as well as circuit depth, which are quantified in the study.", "conclusion": "The LSH approach offers a more efficient way to encode SU(3) dynamics into a quantum simulation, and the oracle algorithm provides a method to ensure that the constraints are satisfied during the simulation, thus improving the accuracy and feasibility of quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories."}}
