Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \\ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Concretely, we compute by numerical simulations this operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields.
