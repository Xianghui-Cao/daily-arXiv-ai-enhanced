Habibi", "Lingxiao Wang", "Kai Zhou"], "title": "Combining complex Langevin dynamics with score-based and energy-based diffusion models", "comment": "22 pages, many figures", "summary": "Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can\nsometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified\nconfiguration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled\nby this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to\nunderstand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or\ntheir log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to\nlearn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing\nscore-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible\napplications."}

We tested seven\nsupervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models and found that most\nof them were very successful in that task, even outperforming standard methods\nbased on order parameters."}

We investigate the evolution of\nthe field as the temperature increases through and beyond the chiral\ntransition. For all the temperatures considered we find clear evidence of a\nchromo-magnetic current and of a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric\nfield that stays almost uniform along the flux tube. In the high-temperature\nregion the magnitude of the flux-tube field is determined by an effective\nstring tension that decreases exponentially as the temperature increases, while\nthe flux-tube width decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. Our\nresults suggest that beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature the\nquark-antiquark system can be characterized by a screened string tension."}
