### [1] [Group-Equivariant Diffusion Models for Lattice Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26081)
*Octavio Vega,Javad Komijani,Aida El-Khadra,Marina Marinkovic*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of score-based symmetry-preserving diffusion models to sample 2D φ⁴ and U(1) lattice field theories, as an alternative to MCMC simulations which suffer from critical slowing down near the critical point. The authors develop equivariant score networks that are trained with an augmented scheme, improving sample quality and outperforming generic score networks in various aspects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to address the inefficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations when sampling lattice quantum field theories (LQFT) close to the critical point, due to a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. The authors propose an alternative approach using score-based symmetry-preserving diffusion models to overcome this limitation.

Method: The method involves developing score networks that maintain equivariance under several group transformations such as global Z₂ reflections, local U(1) rotations, and periodic translations T. These score networks are then trained using an augmented training scheme, which has been shown to enhance the quality of samples generated by the model.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed symmetry-aware models provide better sample quality, expressivity, and effective sample size compared to generic score networks. The empirical evidence supports the superiority of the developed models in simulating 2D φ⁴ and U(1) lattice field theories.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this work is that score-based symmetry-preserving diffusion models offer a promising alternative to traditional MCMC methods for sampling LQFTs, particularly in the vicinity of the critical point, where MCMC suffers from critical slowing down. The enhanced performance of the symmetry-aware models suggests their potential for broader applications in the field.

Abstract: Near the critical point, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of
lattice quantum field theories (LQFT) become increasingly inefficient due to
critical slowing down. In this work, we investigate score-based
symmetry-preserving diffusion models as an alternative strategy to sample
two-dimensional $\phi^4$ and ${\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories. We develop
score networks that are equivariant to a range of group transformations,
including global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflections, local ${\rm U}(1)$ rotations, and
periodic translations $\mathbb{T}$. The score networks are trained using an
augmented training scheme, which significantly improves sample quality in the
simulated field theories. We also demonstrate empirically that our
symmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks in sample quality,
expressivity, and effective sample size.

TL;DR: Researchers have created a new, highly efficient code for simulating nucleon interactions on supercomputers, achieving up to 240 times the speed of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the delicate balance of nucleon interactions and its impact on the universe's hydrogen content, which is crucial for our existence, by varying the parameters of nature and computing the interaction strength.

Method: Developed a new code using advanced physics algorithms and an optimized library for CPU-GPU parallel architecture simulations. The code was tested on several supercomputers for performance and scalability.

Result: The new code demonstrated excellent weak scaling and linear scaling with an increasing number of nodes, achieving a disruptive speed-up of approximately 240 times over the previous state-of-the-art on various supercomputers.

Conclusion: The study marks the beginning of a new era in supercomputing, enabling faster and more detailed simulations of nucleon interactions, which could lead to a better understanding of nuclear phenomena and the development of the universe.

Abstract: The vast majority of visible matter in our universe comes from protons and
neutrons (the nucleons). Nucleon interactions are fundamental to how the
universe developed after the Big Bang and govern all nuclear phenomena. The
subtle balance in how two nucleons interact shapes the universe's hydrogen
content that is central to our existence. Our objective is to compute the
interaction strength while varying the parameters of nature to understand how
delicate this balance is. We developed a new code using sophisticated physics
algorithms and a highly optimized library for simulations on CPU-GPU parallel
architectures. It has excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling for
a fixed problem size with increasing number of nodes up to El Capitan's full
$\sim$11,000 nodes. On Alps, El Capitan, Frontier, Jupiter, and Perlmutter
supercomputers we achieve a maximum disruptive speed-up of $\sim$240 times the
previous state-of-the-art, signaling a new era of supercomputing.

*Chen Chen,Hongxin Dong,Liuming Liu,Peng Sun,Xiaonu Xiong,Yi-Bo Yang,Fei Yao,Jian-Hui Zhang,Chunhua Zeng,Shiyi Zhong*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper describes a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function using large-momentum effective theory, with results agreeing with global analysis within error margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a precise calculation of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using lattice QCD, which is important for understanding the structure of the nucleon and for high-energy physics experiments.

Method: The method involves using 2+1 flavor CLS ensembles with three different lattice spacings and a pion mass of about 300 MeV. The researchers apply distillation techniques to enhance the signal of two-point correlators, use hybrid renormalization, and perform one-loop perturbative matching. They then extrapolate the findings to the continuum and infinite momentum limit.

Result: The result is a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon PDF that is consistent with results from global analysis within the error bars, providing a valuable cross-check for experimental data and theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the lattice QCD calculations, when performed with the described methodology, can yield accurate results for the nucleon gluon PDF, which are in agreement with those obtained from global fits, thus validating the approach and its potential for future studies.

Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon
parton distribution function employing large-momentum effective theory. The
calculation is carried out on the 2+1 flavour CLQCD ensembles with three
lattice spacings a={0.105,0.0897,0.0775} fm and pion mass of approximately 300
MeV, covering nulceon momenta up to 1.97 GeV. Distillation technique is applied
to improve the signal of two-point correlators. We then apply the
state-of-the-art hybrid renormalization and one-loop perturbative matching, and
extrapolate the result to the continuum and infinite momentum limit. Our result
is in agreement with that from global analysis within errors.

### [4] [Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26455)
*Szabolcs Borsányi,Zoltán Fodor,Jana N. Guenther,Piyush Kumar,Paolo Parotto,Attila Pásztor,Chik Him Wong*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers use lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential to study the QCD phase diagram at large density, finding that strangeness neutrality conditions lead to constant values of strangeness chemical potential and susceptibility at the chiral transition. They extrapolate these constants to finite baryon chemical potential and show agreement with hadron resonance gas model predictions, suggesting a deviation in the crossover line near 500 MeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to map out the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at high baryon density, which is difficult due to the sign problem in lattice simulations. The researchers aim to find reliable proxies for the QCD crossover that are not significantly affected by criticality or finite volume effects, and to compare their results with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model.

Method: The method involves lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential, imposing strangeness neutrality, and observing the behavior of strangeness chemical potential and susceptibility. The team then uses next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion, and in some cases up to N$^4$LO, to extrapolate these quantities to real, finite baryon chemical potential, and performs a continuum limit analysis.

Result: The results show that the contours of constant strangeness chemical potential and strangeness susceptibility can be extrapolated to finite baryon chemical potential with good agreement between different lattice sizes and with the HRG model. The extrapolation suggests that the crossover line starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line around 500 MeV baryon chemical potential.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the observed constant values of strangeness chemical potential and susceptibility under strangeness neutrality provide a robust proxy for the QCD crossover, and the extrapolations to finite baryon chemical potential are consistent with the HRG model, indicating a potential deviation in the crossover line near 500 MeV, which is in line with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density
is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations.
Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ we observe
that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness
chemical potential $\mu_S/\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\chi_2^S$
take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\mu_B$. We
present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\mu_S/\mu_B$ or
$\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good
proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly
influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum
limits for these proxies up to $\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a
next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on
large-statistics data on $16^3 \times 8$, $20^3 \times 10$ and $24^3 \times 12$
lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in
excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and,
strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas
(HRG) model. On the $16^3 \times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the
extrapolation beyond $\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the
HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy
starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $\mu_B\approx500$ MeV,
as expected but not yet observed.

### [5] [Position-space sampling for local multiquark operators in lattice QCD using distillation and the importance of tetraquark operators for $T_{cc}(3875)^+$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26459)
*Andres Stump,Jeremy R. Green*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a position-space sampling method to reduce the computational cost of local multiquark operators in the distillation framework, demonstrating its efficiency and impact on the finite-volume spectrum of T_cc(3875)^+ through the inclusion of local tetraquark operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost associated with local multiquark operators (four or more (anti)quarks) within the distillation method, which is otherwise efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson and baryon-baryon operators.

Method: A position-space sampling method is presented, which performs momentum projection over sparse grids instead of the full spatial lattice to reduce the cost scaling of contractions. The method is applied to single-meson, single-baryon, and local tetraquark operators using Wilson-clover fermions at the SU(3)-flavor-symmetric point. The study also extends a basis of bilocal DD* and D*D* scattering operators by including local tetraquark operators to assess their importance for the T_cc(3875)^+ spectrum.

Result: The results show that the new method is an efficient and unbiased estimator, leading to significant shifts in several energy levels when local tetraquark operators are included in the basis. These shifts have an effect on the DD* scattering phase shift from a single-channel s-wave Lüsher analysis.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the position-space sampling method within distillation is effective in reducing the computational cost for local multiquark operators, and the inclusion of local tetraquark operators has a notable impact on the finite-volume spectrum, suggesting their importance for accurate spectroscopy calculations.

Abstract: Obtaining hadronic two-point functions is a central step in spectroscopy
calculations in lattice QCD. This requires solving the Dirac equation
repeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method
addresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial
Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully
inverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson
and baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or
more (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of
contractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors.
We present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces
this cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids
rather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this
unbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark
operators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point,
we apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for
the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large
basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local
tetraquark operators. The inclusion of local operators leads to significant
shifts in several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on
the $DD^*$ scattering phase shift from a single-channel $s$-wave L\"uscher
analysis.

### [6] [Generative sampling with physics-informed kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26678)
*Friederike Ihssen,Renzo Kapust,Jan M. Pawlowski*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories is presented, using physics-informed renormalisation group flows to optimize layerwise propagation and solve out-of-domain problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient and effective method for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories that can handle the out-of-domain issues commonly faced by generative models. The aim is to leverage the understanding of physics, specifically through renormalisation group (RG) flows, to guide the learning process and improve the generative task.

Method: The method involves constructing a generative network where the learning and optimization of each layer's propagation are done independently. This is achieved by employing RG flows, which provide a first-order partial differential equation for the transformation between layers. The kernels of this transformation are then solved as a set of independent and linear differential equations, allowing for iterative refinement and structural handling of out-of-domain problems.

Result: The result is a practical architecture that has been demonstrated to be feasible within simulations of scalar field theories. It offers a way to transform the generative task into a series of solvable differential equations, thus improving the sampling process and potentially leading to further optimizations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the successful illustration of the proposed architecture's feasibility and its potential to address out-of-domain problems, paving the way for future advancements and optimizations in generative modeling for lattice field theories.

Abstract: We construct a generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field
theories and beyond, for which the learning of layerwise propagation is done
and optimised independently on each layer. The architecture uses
physics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the
layerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple
first order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation
group kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task
into that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential
equations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are
analytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to
structurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative
models and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical
feasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories.

### [7] [Moments of parton distributions functions of the pion from lattice QCD using gradient flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26738)
*Anthony Francis,Patrick Fritzsch,Rohith Karur,Jangho Kim,Giovanni Pederiva,Dimitra A. Pefkou,Antonio Rago,Andrea Shindler,André Walker-Loud,Savvas Zafeiropoulos*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a nonperturbative determination of pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios using the gradient flow in lattice QCD, with results that are consistent with phenomenological expectations and competitive statistical uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide an efficient and systematically improvable method for accessing partonic quantities from first principles, using the gradient flow technique in lattice QCD, which can be applied to understand the structure of the pion and potentially other hadrons like the nucleon.

Method: The researchers use SU(3) isosymmetric gauge configurations with a pseudoscalar mass close to 411 MeV, four different lattice spacings, and a nonperturbatively improved action. They employ the gradient flow to compute PDF moment ratios, which are then matched to the MS-bar scheme at a scale of 2 GeV, and they extrapolate to the continuum limit to control systematic errors.

Result: The results show O(a^2) scaling across the ensembles and mild residual flow-time dependence after continuum extrapolation. The computed PDF moment ratios agree with phenomenological expectations and have statistical uncertainties comparable to those from modern global fits, even with a limited number of configurations used in the analysis.

Conclusion: The gradient flow technique proves to be an effective and systematically improvable approach for determining partonic quantities. Future work will focus on extending the study to lighter pion masses and applying the method to nucleon structure, including proton PDFs and gluon and sea-quark distributions.

Abstract: We present a nonperturbative determination of the pion valence parton
distribution function (PDF) moment ratios $\left\langle x^{n-1} \right\rangle /
\left\langle x \right\rangle$ up to $n=6$, using the gradient flow in lattice
QCD. As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations
generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_\pi \simeq
411~\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a
nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum
extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\to0$. The flowed ratios
exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated
results, matched to the $\overline {\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV using
next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual
flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small
number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for
the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are
competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the
gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to
access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this
work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and
applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and
sea-quark distributions.
