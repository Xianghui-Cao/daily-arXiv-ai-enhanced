TL;DR: The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude for the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, achieving 25% statistical precision and identifying a destructive interference with the short-distance part.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more accurate understanding of the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay by calculating the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude using lattice QCD, which has not been done before with this level of precision and detail.

Method: The method involves using a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an inverse lattice spacing of 1.023 GeV, along with a QED$_\infty$-based formalism, and implementing strategies for all five non-SU(3)-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies to compute the amplitude with 25% statistical precision.

Result: A 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the long-distance amplitude was achieved, and it was found that there is a destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude. The precision of the results is limited by the reconstruction of the $\eta$ intermediate state contribution, with various strategies tested and compared.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study provides a first-principles determination of the long-distance amplitude's contribution to the $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, revealing a destructive interference with the short-distance part, and highlights the need for further refinement in the treatment of the $\eta$ intermediate state to improve the precision of the results.

Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which
contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice
QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an
inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism.
Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed
diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision
on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a
destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the
decay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The
precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical
contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are
tested and compared.
