*Sebastian Grieninger,Jake Montgomery,Felix Ringer,Ismail Zahed*

Main category: hep-lat

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the internal structure of hadrons through the study of Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) and to provide a computational framework that can be extended to more complex theories.

Method: The researchers used the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory and tensor networks to prepare and boost the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime of the massive Schwinger model. They computed both quasi-parton distribution functions and quasi-GPDs, and compared their results with analytic calculations in specific approximations.

Result: The results include the computation of quasi-GPDs and an analysis of their convergence as the states are increasingly boosted. The study also provides qualitative benchmarks by comparing the numerical results with analytical calculations in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study establishes computational benchmarks for partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories and sets a foundation for extending the research to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.

Abstract: Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) are off-diagonal light-cone matrix elements that encode the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers used the O(4) non-linear σ-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD to explore the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density, finding that the critical temperature decreases with increasing baryonic chemical potential, and no Critical Endpoint (CEP) was found within the explored range, though hints suggest it may be near the maximum μ_B value investigated.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the largely uncharted QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density, which remains a challenge due to the sign problem in lattice QCD simulations. The researchers aim to find a way around this issue by using an alternative theoretical model.

Method: The method involves employing the O(4) non-linear σ-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD, assuming high-temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, and including the baryonic chemical potential in the lattice formulation without causing a sign problem, allowing Monte Carlo simulations to determine the critical line.

Result: The result is that the critical temperature T_c decreases monotonically as the baryonic chemical potential μ_B increases. No Critical Endpoint (CEP) was identified in the given range, but there are indications that a CEP might be located near the highest μ_B values studied.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that through the use of the O(4) non-linear σ-model, the researchers were able to simulate the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density and map out the critical line, although the presence of a CEP could not be confirmed within the accessible parameter space.

Abstract: Despite intense experimental and theoretical research, the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density remains to a large extent unexplored. From the theoretical side, the obvious non-perturbative approach is lattice QCD simulations, which are, however, obstructed by a severe sign problem. Here we employ the O(4) non-linear $σ$-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class. We assume high temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, with topological charge taking the role of the baryon number, along the lines of Skyrme's model. In this effective formulation, the baryonic chemical potential $μ_{B}$ can be included in the lattice formulation without causing any sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations. This allows us to pin down the critical line, i.e. the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}(μ_{B})$, which decreases monotonically for increasing $μ_{B}$. In the range $0 < μ_{B} \lesssim 309~{\rm MeV}$ and $132~{\rm MeV} \gtrsim T_{\rm c} \gtrsim 106~{\rm MeV}$, we do not find a Critical Endpoint (CEP), although there are hints for it to be in the vicinity of the maximal $μ_{B}$-value that we could explore.

### [3] [Precision estimates of large charge RG exponents $Y_q$ in the 3D XY universality class](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18321)
*Martin Hasenbusch*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper computes the RG exponents $Y_q$ for large $q$ fields at the $O(2)$ invariant fixed point in 3D using an improved worm algorithm, showing excellent agreement with large $q$ effective field theory down to $q=4$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accurately determine the RG exponents for large $q$ fields and compare them with the predictions of the large $q$ effective field theory, thus providing a better understanding of the critical behavior in these systems.

Method: The authors use an iterative approach enhanced by the worm algorithm, which includes weights in the update process. They simulate an improved XY model that includes next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest-neighbor ones, allowing for accurate results up to $q=64$.

Result: The study provides precise values for $Y_q$ for various $q$, such as $Y_2 = 1.76370(12)$, $Y_3 = 0.89167(23)$, and $Y_4 = -0.11203(34)$. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory shows a good match down to $q=4$ and yields accurate estimates of the theory's parameters.

Conclusion: The method used in the paper is effective in calculating the RG exponents for large $q$ fields and demonstrates a strong agreement with the large $q$ effective field theory, suggesting that the approach can be used to estimate the parameters of the effective field theory with high accuracy.

Abstract: We accurately compute the RG exponents $Y_q$ of large $q$ fields at the $O(2)$ invariant fixed point in three dimensions. We build on an iterative approach that has been previously proposed and is implemented by using the worm algorithm. We simulate an improved XY model, that has next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest ones. In the worm update we incorporate weights, which allows us to obtain accurate results up to $q=64$. For example we get $Y_q=1.76370(12)$, $0.89167(23)$, and $-0.11203(34)$ for $q=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory gives an excellent agreement down to $q=4$ and provides accurate estimates of the parameters of the effective field theory.
