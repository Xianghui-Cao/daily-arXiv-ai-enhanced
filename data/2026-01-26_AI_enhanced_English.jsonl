We extend Wegner duality to arbitrary topology and dimension, obtaining a new class of Ising models, in which topology is encoded in non-local domain-wall patterns. Without the overhead of gauge constraints, simulating this model on an L*L torus requires only L*L qubits with two-body couplings, halving the conventional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits, enabling full experimental realization of Z2 lattice gauge theory on near-term devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper extends Wegner duality to any topology and dimension, leading to a new type of Ising model that reduces the qubit requirement for simulating Z2 lattice gauge theory, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices.", "motivation": "The motivation is to make the simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory more accessible on near-term quantum devices by reducing the number of required qubits and simplifying the coupling requirements.", "method": "The authors extend the concept of Wegner duality to apply to any topological space and dimension, creating a new class of Ising models where the topology is represented through non-local domain-wall patterns. This approach avoids the need for gauge constraints, which usually complicate the simulation.", "result": "By using this new model, the simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory on an L*L torus can be achieved with only L*L qubits and two-body couplings, significantly reducing the complexity compared to the traditional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits setup.", "conclusion": "The extension of Wegner duality allows for a more efficient and practical simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory, potentially enabling its full experimental realization on current and near-future quantum computing platforms."}}

The isospin $I=2$ system is of particular interest having no three-body resonance but featuring a resonance in a sub-channel, while also being a coupled-channel problem. In this study, we calculate the finite-volume spectrum from lattice QC at two different pion masses, map the amplitude to the infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigate the limit of a narrow $\u03c1$, and compare with an effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order. Chiral extrapolations between different pion masses are performed.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the dynamics of a three-body system with isospin I=2 using lattice QCD, analyzing its finite-volume spectrum and comparing it to predictions from an effective Lagrangian at leading order, while also performing chiral extrapolations for different pion masses.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD, focusing on a system that has no three-body resonance but features a resonance in a sub-channel, and is a coupled-channel problem.", "method": "The method involves calculating the finite-volume spectrum using lattice QCD, mapping the amplitude to infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigating the limit of a narrow \u03c1, and performing chiral extrapolations between different pion masses.", "result": "Results include the calculated finite-volume spectra, the mapped amplitudes to the infinite volume, the investigation of the narrow \u03c1 limit, and the comparison with the effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order, as well as the chiral extrapolation outcomes.", "conclusion": "The conclusion would be the validation or refutation of the theoretical framework used, the accuracy of the effective Lagrangian prediction, and insights into the three-body dynamics of the isospin I=2 system, including the behavior of the system with varying pion masses."}}
