TL;DR: The paper uses numerical simulations to study the phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields, employing two order parameters to distinguish between deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs phases.

Motivation: The motivation is to re-examine the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature when coupled with Higgs fields, aiming to clearly differentiate between its three distinct phases using specific order parameters.

Method: The method involves numerical simulation, focusing on two particular order parameters: the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator for differentiating between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases, and the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator for distinguishing between confinement and Higgs phases.

Result: The result is an improved understanding and distinction of the three phases (deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs) within the (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory through the use of specified order parameters in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the application of both the Fredenhagen-Marcu and Greensite-Matsuyama operators effectively distinguishes the deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs phases, providing a clearer picture of the phase structure in the presence of Higgs fields.

Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the
(3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with gauge fields coupled to
Higgs fields at finite temperature. Concretely, we explore two different order
parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i)
the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and
confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator
proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases.
