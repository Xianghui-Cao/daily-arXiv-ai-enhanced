The collision of these pairs of\neigenvalues occurs outside the perturbative region and provides a path between\ntopological sectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the Wilson formulation of fermions in lattice gauge theory, which explains chiral anomalies through the behavior of eigenvalues of the discrete Dirac operator.", "motivation": "To provide a unified description of chiral anomalies within the standard model using the Wilson formulation, and to explore the non-perturbative aspects that connect different topological sectors via the collision of eigenvalue pairs.", "method": "The method involves analyzing the discrete Dirac operator, which is broken down into two by two blocks, and studying the possible eigenvalues that can form complex pairs or separate into real values with specific chirality.", "result": "The analysis reveals that the collision of eigenvalue pairs happens outside the perturbative region and this phenomenon provides a transition path between distinct topological sectors.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the Wilson formulation offers insight into chiral anomalies and the non-perturbative transitions between topological sectors, which are essential for understanding the full dynamics of the standard model."}}
