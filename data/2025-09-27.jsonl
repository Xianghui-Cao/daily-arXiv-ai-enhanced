Our method\nemploys an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit\nstructure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our\nsimulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification\nof phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors.\nClassical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters,\nwhich are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude\nby discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to\nlarger systems."}
