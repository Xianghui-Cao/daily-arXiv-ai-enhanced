### [1] [The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21333)
*B. A. Ngwenya,A. K. Rothkopf,W. A. Horowitz*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in SU(3) gauge theory for geometries such as parallel plates, symmetrical tubes, and boxes, revealing an attractive Casimir effect. The study also proposes methods to account for energy contributions from boundaries and shows that temperature changes do not affect the Casimir potential.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory for geometries beyond parallel plates, which has not been done before, and to understand how boundary conditions and temperature phases (confined vs. deconfined) impact the Casimir effect.

Method: The researchers used non-perturbative methods to calculate the Casimir potential for different geometries in both (2+1)D and (3+1)D. They also proposed methods to correct for the energy associated with creating the boundaries of the geometries under investigation.

Result: The results show that for symmetrical tubes and boxes, the Casimir effect is attractive, contrary to expectations from massless non-interacting scalar field theory. Additionally, the change in temperature from confined to deconfined phase does not modify the Casimir potential, supporting the idea of a boundary-induced deconfined phase.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory can be determined for various geometries, and it exhibits an attractive force for symmetrical tubes and boxes. The findings suggest that the Casimir potential is not influenced by the phase transition due to temperature, indicating the presence of a boundary-induced deconfined phase.

Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian
SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase.
For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored
and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical
box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless
non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir
potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size
is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the
walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various
methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating
the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a
deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is
consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a
boundary induced deconfined phase.

Main category: hep-lat

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm for higher dimensions, particularly in four-dimensional lattice theories, to address the sign problem in lattice QCD at finite density and reduce computational cost.

Method: The authors propose the Triad-ATRG, a novel algorithm that builds upon the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG) and incorporates triad network representation, alongside providing parallel implementations on multiple GPUs to increase computational speed and efficiency.

Result: The Triad-ATRG method demonstrates lower scaling with bond dimension and reduced loss of accuracy in physical quantities such as free energy. The parallel GPU implementation significantly outperforms CPU-based calculations for 4D systems.

Conclusion: The Triad-ATRG algorithm offers a promising solution for overcoming the sign problem in lattice QCD at finite density, with improved computational efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for 4D lattice simulations.

Abstract: The development of tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm in higher
dimensions is an important and urgent task, as the TRG is expected to provide a
way to overcome the sign problem in lattice QCD calculations at finite density.
One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional
lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG).
However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant
computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called
the Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with
triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect
to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy
and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both
the ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve
performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.
