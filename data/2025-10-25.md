TL;DR: A mixed action approach in lattice QCD is introduced, using Wilson-type quarks in both sea and valence sectors. The method involves gauge ensembles with 2+1 flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions, and the valence sector uses Wilson twisted-mass fermions. A mass matching strategy is described, and a universality test compares results from mixed-action and unitary setups. Scale setting is performed using pion and kaon masses and decay constants, as well as the gradient flow scale $t_0$, with the combination of both approaches providing a more precise determination of $t_0$.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a mixed action approach that can be used for simulations in lattice QCD, which allows for a comparison between different regularizations (mixed-action and unitary) and provides a means to set the scale with high precision by combining the advantages of both methods.

Method: The method employs a mixed action setup with non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson fermions in the sea sector and Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist in the valence sector. It includes a mass matching procedure and a universality test through the comparison of continuum-limit results from the mixed-action and unitary setups. Scale setting is achieved using the masses and decay constants of pions and kaons, along with the gradient flow scale $t_0$.

Result: The result is a successful implementation of a mixed-action approach in lattice QCD, with a demonstration of its consistency with the unitary setup. The combination of both approaches leads to an enhanced control over systematic uncertainties, resulting in a more precise determination of the physical value of the gradient flow scale $t_0$.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the mixed-action approach is consistent with the unitary setup, and when combined, they provide a powerful tool for scale setting in lattice QCD, offering a significant reduction in systematic uncertainties and a more accurate determination of the physical value of $t_0$.

Abstract: We introduce a lattice QCD mixed action approach that employs Wilson-type
quarks in the sea and valence sectors. The sea sector is based on gauge
ensembles with $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved
Wilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)
initiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five
values of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the
physical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ
Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless
Wilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the
strategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses
along the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is
then conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action
approach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion
regularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,
we conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the
masses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow
scale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct
ways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their
combination. We observe that the latter combination results in enhanced control
of the systematic uncertainties, thereby yielding a precise determination of
the physical value of $t_0$.
