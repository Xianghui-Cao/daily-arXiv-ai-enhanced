Motivation: The motivation is to provide accurate determinations of the meson mass spectrum and low-energy constants in the context of large-N QCD, as well as to investigate the radial Regge trajectories of the π and ρ channels and assess sub-leading 1/N corrections.

Method: The method involves large-N twisted volume reduction for efficient numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice discretized theory, using multiple values of N (up to 841), five different lattice spacings, and several quark masses to perform controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.

Result: The results include the determination of the low-lying meson mass spectrum, the quark condensate Σ, the pion decay constant F_π, and the next-to-leading-order coupling ℓ̄_4, as well as an investigation into the radial Regge trajectories of the π and ρ channels and an assessment of the magnitude of 1/N sub-leading corrections.

Conclusion: The conclusions are that the research provides robust determinations of the meson mass spectrum and QCD low-energy constants at large N, and it offers insights into the behavior of radial Regge trajectories and the size of 1/N corrections by combining infinite-N results with previous finite-N studies.

Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying
meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit
$N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy
constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$,
the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling
$\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$
channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge
trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the
magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$
results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits
large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo
simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several
values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several
values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral
extrapolations.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel temperature estimator for lattice gauge theories, based on the field configuration and inspired by geometric entropy formulations in classical statistical mechanics, is presented. This estimator is validated across various dimensions and conditions in compact U(1) theories, showing accuracy and robustness. It can be a valuable tool for a wide range of applications in lattice field theory simulations.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a reliable, gauge-invariant, and non-kinetic method to estimate the temperature in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories, which is crucial for ensuring thermodynamic consistency. The new estimator aims to provide a more general diagnostic tool that can be applied across different types of lattice field theories, including non-Abelian and anisotropic lattices, and for real-time monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.

Method: The method involves constructing a temperature estimator from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action of the theory, drawing inspiration from geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics. The approach is designed to be gauge-invariant and non-kinetic, providing a measure of thermodynamic consistency. The validation of the estimator was performed using compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions, with comparisons made between the estimated and input temperatures under varying lattice volumes and coupling strengths.

Result: The results demonstrate that the temperature estimator accurately reproduces the input temperature across different dimensions, lattice volumes, and coupling strengths. The estimator shows robust performance, indicating its potential as a general-purpose diagnostic tool for lattice field theory simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the developed temperature estimator provides an accurate and robust method for assessing thermodynamic consistency in lattice gauge theory simulations. It has been shown to be effective in compact U(1) theories and holds promise for application in non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time diagnostics within hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.

Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge
theories. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean
action of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in
classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant,
non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations
of lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge
theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated
temperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator
accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range
of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a
general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential
applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time
monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.
