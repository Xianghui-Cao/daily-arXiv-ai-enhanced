### [1] [Higher order quantization conditions for two-body scattering with spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17924)
*Lucas Chandler,Frank X. Lee,Andrei Alexandru*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Lüscher quantization condition for scattering processes in a periodic box, focusing on particles with and without spin. It derives and validates quantization conditions up to high angular momentum, in different geometries and frames, and introduces a method to check their convergence using both energy levels and phase shifts. The work is essential for precision studies of systems with half-integer spin in finite volume.

Motivation: The motivation is to advance the theoretical framework for studying particle interactions in a finite volume, especially for systems involving particles with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering, by providing a reliable and convergent set of quantization conditions that can be used in precision calculations.

Method: The authors derive the Lüscher quantization conditions in a non-relativistic setting for particles with and without spin, considering total angular momenta up to J=11/2. They consider both cubic and elongated box geometries and analyze the conditions in rest and moving frames. A novel method for checking the convergence of the quantization conditions using both the discrete energy spectrum and infinite-volume phase shifts is introduced and applied.

Result: A total of 19 quantization conditions are validated, with 12 for the cubic box and 7 for the elongated box. The study demonstrates the convergence of the quantization conditions order by order and provides a detailed analysis of how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism. The results ensure the applicability of the method for precision studies of systems with half-integer spin in a finite volume.

Conclusion: The derived and validated quantization conditions provide a robust basis for future precision studies of meson-baryon and other systems with half-integer spin within a finite volume. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and the demonstrated convergence of the conditions across different geometries and frames significantly enhance the utility of the Lüscher's method for these complex systems.

Abstract: We examine the Lüscher quantization condition to high order for the scattering of a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle in a periodic box. First, we derive the quantization conditions in a non-relativistic framework up to total angular momentum $J=11/2$ in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for both rest and moving frames. Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations. In all, we validated 19 quantization conditions (12 in cubic box, 7 in elongated box). This is a necessary step in applying the method in precision studies of systems in finite volume with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering.

TL;DR: Researchers used a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor to simulate hadron dynamics within a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory, successfully observing light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations. The results, validated against classical algorithms, suggest quantum processors can maintain robustness in simulating non-Abelian dynamics as the system approaches the weak-coupling or continuum limit, where classical methods face exponential complexity or symmetry violations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to advance the real-time simulation of strongly interacting matter, which is a challenge for classical simulations due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and entanglement-driven issues in tensor networks. The study aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in overcoming these limitations, particularly in the context of high-energy physics and non-Abelian dynamics, by providing a scalable pathway for such simulations on near-term quantum hardware.

Method: The method involves using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor to perform a quantum simulation of hadron dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory. A hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding is applied to simulate the dynamics on a 60-site lattice. The researchers also use a differential measurement protocol along with error mitigation techniques to obtain high-fidelity results directly from the quantum data. The outcomes are then benchmarked against state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on tensor network methods and the Pauli propagation method.

Result: The key result is the successful observation of light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations that indicate early-time hadronic breathing modes. The quantum simulation results show structural robustness as the system approaches the weak-coupling or continuum limit, in contrast to classical methods, which experience an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations. This suggests that quantum processors may offer a practical advantage over classical methods in simulating non-Abelian dynamics.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this research is that there is a viable and scalable approach to simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware, which could lead to a practical quantum advantage in the field of high-energy physics. The study demonstrates that quantum processors can maintain robustness in simulations where classical methods encounter significant challenges, thus paving the way for future large-scale quantum simulations.

Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.

### [3] [Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18360)

TL;DR: The study explores the phase structure of a model with two flavors of massless staggered fermions and two four-fermion couplings. It shows that introducing a small nonzero UB value changes the phase structure, splitting a single transition into two conventional transitions with an intermediate SSB phase. The critical exponents for both transitions are consistent with established values, providing a quantitative description of the model's phase structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how the introduction of a second four-fermion coupling (UB) affects the known phase structure of a model at UB = 0, which has a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion phase and a symmetric mass generation phase. The aim is to explore the nature of the new phases and transitions that arise when UB is not zero.

Method: The researchers use the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method to simulate the model on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice and analyze the resulting phase structure. They look for changes in the phase diagram as they vary the strength of the UB coupling, and they measure the critical exponents associated with the observed phase transitions.

Result: The results show that a small, nonzero UB causes the original single transition to split into two distinct transitions: a Gross-Neveu transition from the massless fermion phase to a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase, and a 3D XY transition from the SSB phase to the symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase. The critical exponents of these transitions are found to be consistent with those reported in the literature.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the addition of a nonzero UB coupling qualitatively changes the phase structure, leading to the appearance of a new intermediate SSB phase. The model's phase structure is quantitatively characterized by the critical exponents of the two separate transitions, confirming the theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model.
