We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $\u03bc_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\\!+\\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $\u03bc_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $\u03bc_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\\{T,\u03bc_B\\}$ and the scaling variable (\\textit{i.e.}\\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$\u03bc_B$ expansion, the resulting $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $\u03bc_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$\u03bc_B$ regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a new method combining Lee-Yang edge and universal chiral scaling to estimate the QCD crossover line down to 108 MeV, demonstrating consistency with known results and potential for further exploration of the QCD phase diagram.", "motivation": "To provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line at temperatures down to approximately 108 MeV, and to develop a method that can be used to explore the QCD phase diagram in the low-temperature, high-baryon chemical potential regime.", "method": "A novel approach is utilized, which integrates the Lee-Yang edge phenomenon observed in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential with the principles of universal chiral scaling. This involves (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations carried out at a temperature around 108 MeV using purely imaginary baryon chemical potentials, with calculations performed at a single lattice spacing and on two different volumes.", "result": "The research successfully computes baryon-number susceptibilities dependent on the baryon chemical potential, identifies the position of the Lee-Yang edge, and determines the mapping function between temperature and baryon chemical potential. The method provides a consistent \u03bc_B dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature, aligning with previous small-\u03bc_B determinations and heavy-ion collision freeze-out parameters.", "conclusion": "The proposed method proves to be valid and robust, as it is consistent with established lattice-QCD results and freeze-out conditions from heavy-ion collisions. It has the potential to be applied across a range of temperatures and with finer discretizations, enabling the exploration of the QCD phase diagram in previously uncharted territories."}}
