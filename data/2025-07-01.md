### [1] [Polyakov loop model with exact static quark determinant in the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit: U(N) case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00689)
*S. Voloshyn*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The author analyzes a 3D $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model, including the static determinant with $N_f$ quark flavors. The model is solved exactly in the large $N, N_f$ limit, and key observables such as free energy, Polyakov loop expectation value, and quark condensate are computed. The phase diagram and the nature of the phase transition depend on the ratio $\kappa = N_f/N$.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide an exact solution to a 3D $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model that includes the effects of quark mass and chemical potential, and to understand the phase structure and transitions in terms of the quark flavor to color ratio $\kappa$.

Method: The author employs a mean-field approach, which becomes exact in the large $N, N_f$ limit, to reduce the core of the Polyakov loop model to a deformed unitary matrix model. This model is then solved exactly, allowing for the computation of the free energy, the Polyakov loop's expectation value, and the quark condensate.

Result: The results include the computation of the free energy, the expectation value of the Polyakov loop, and the quark condensate. The phase diagram of the model and the type of phase transition are determined, showing a dependence on the ratio $\kappa = N_f/N$.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the phase diagram and the nature of the phase transition in the 3D $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model, which incorporates the static determinant and quark properties, are significantly influenced by the ratio of quark flavors to colors, $\kappa$. The exact solutions provided offer a deeper understanding of the model's behavior at different values of $\kappa$.

Abstract: I investigate a three-dimensional $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model derived that
includes the exact static determinant with $N_f$ degenerate quark flavor and
depends explicitly on the quark mass and chemical potential. In the large $N,
N_f$ limit mean field gives the exact solution, and the core of the Polyakov
loop model is reduced to a deformed unitary matrix model, which I solve
exactly. I compute the free energy, the expectation value of the Polyakov loop,
and the quark condensate. The phase diagram of the model and the type of phase
transition is investigated and shows it depends on the ratio $\kappa =N_f/N$.
