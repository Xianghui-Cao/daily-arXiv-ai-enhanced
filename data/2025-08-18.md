### [1] [Application of Laplace filters to the analysis of lattice time correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11541)
*Antonin Portelli,Justus Tobias Tsang*

Main category: hep-lat

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address two major issues in the analysis of lattice simulation correlation function data: the ill-conditioning of the Euclidean time covariance matrix and the systematic contamination from unwanted states, which hinders the isolation of a single physical state.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach that utilizes regulated Laplace filters. These filters act as high-pass filters that can suppress local correlations within the data, thereby significantly reducing the condition number of the covariance matrices. The filters also have the ability to annihilate exponentially decaying functions, which allows for the alteration of the spectrum of a lattice correlation function to reduce excited-state contamination.

Result: The results show that the use of regulated Laplace filters can decrease the condition number of covariance matrices by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the application of these filters successfully reduces excited-state contamination, leading to more accurate determinations of matrix elements. The method also has the potential to constrain the spectral content of correlation functions, opening up possibilities for new extraction methods of physical information from lattice data.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that regulated Laplace filters are an effective tool for improving the quality of lattice QCD simulations, particularly in terms of addressing the ill-conditioning of covariance matrices and reducing contamination from excited states, which enhances the accuracy of physical state extractions.

Abstract: The analysis of lattice simulation correlation function data is notoriously
hindered by the ill-conditioning of the Euclidean time covariance matrix.
Additionally, the isolation of a single physical state in such functions is
generally affected by systematic contamination from unwanted states. In this
paper, we present a new methodology based on regulated Laplace filters and
demonstrate that it can be used to address both issues using state-of-the-art
simulation data. Regulated Laplace filters are invertible high-pass filters
that suppress local correlations in the data, and we show that they can reduce
the condition number of covariance matrices by several orders of magnitude.
Furthermore, Laplace filters can annihilate functions that decay exponentially
with time, which can be used to alter the spectrum of a lattice correlation
function. We show that this property can be exploited to significantly reduce
excited-state contamination in the determination of matrix elements. The same
property can also be used to constrain the spectral content of a correlation
function and has the potential to form the basis of new methods to extract
physical information from lattice data.

### [2] [Implementing the finite-volume three-pion scattering formalism across all non-maximal isospins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11627)
*Athari Alotaibi,Maxwell T. Hansen,Raúl A. Briceño*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a numerical exploration of the relativistic-field-theory (RFT) formalism for three pions with all possible non-maximal isospin values, using a generic-isospin extension and an open-source Python library to predict three-pion energy ranges. These predictions serve as a baseline for future lattice QCD calculations, where deviations will indicate intrinsic three-body interaction effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a foundational understanding of three-pion systems in various isospin states, which can be used as a reference for detecting intrinsic three-body interactions in future lattice QCD studies.

Method: The method involves extending the RFT formalism to accommodate non-maximal isospin values and implementing this extended formalism through an open-source Python library to numerically calculate the energies of three-pion systems under different scattering conditions.

Result: The result is a set of predicted energy ranges for three-pion systems across different isospin configurations and scattering amplitudes, which are provided as a baseline for comparison in future research on three-body interactions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the calculated three-pion spectra without intrinsic three-body interactions establish a baseline, and any deviations from these results in future lattice QCD calculations will signal the presence of such interactions.

Abstract: We present a numerical exploration of the relativistic-field-theory (RFT)
formalism for three pions with all possible values of non-maximal isospin,
$I_{\pi\pi\pi} = 2$, $1$ and $0$. Using the generic-isospin extension of the
RFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the
framework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of
the two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with
non-zero total momentum $\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results
restrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction
so that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD
calculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for
intrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels.
