### [1] [Improving the Precision of First-Principles Calculation of Parton Physics from Lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00247)
*Yong Zhao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: LaMET is a theory for computing the proton's partonic structure using lattice QCD. Advances in renormalization and matching have improved its accuracy, while new lattice techniques promise to further extend its predictive power. The field is progressing towards more precise and systematic studies of parton physics, which will benefit nuclear and particle experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a reliable and accurate method for calculating the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first principles, using lattice QCD, with the aim of improving the precision and control of such calculations for the benefit of nuclear and particle physics research.

Method: LaMET uses a power expansion and perturbative matching of quasi-distributions, which are Euclidean observables evaluated at large proton momenta. It incorporates recent advances in lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon resummation, and employs an improved matching kernel that includes higher-loop corrections and resummations. Additionally, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach is used to simplify analyses and improve precision, particularly for transverse-momentum-dependent structures.

Result: Recent LaMET calculations have produced parton observables with significant phenomenological impact. New kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators offer access to high proton momenta with better signal-to-noise ratios, which will broaden the scope of predictions and reduce power corrections. Ongoing work addresses challenges like excited-state contamination and extraction of gluonic distributions, benefiting from emerging ground-state isolation and noise reduction methods.

Conclusion: Lattice QCD studies of parton physics through LaMET have reached a stage of advanced precision and systematic improvement, with the potential to significantly impact nuclear and particle experiments by providing more accurate and controlled partonic structure information.

Abstract: Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for
computing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first
principles using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field
theory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion
and perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables --
quasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in
lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon
resummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates
higher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative
and power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical
uncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further
simplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of
transverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative
region. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton
observables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently
proposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access
to unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios,
which will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power
corrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state
contamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions,
are expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state
isolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have
entered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement,
which will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.

### [2] [$S$-wave kaon-nucleon interactions from lattice QCD on the physical point](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00838)
*Kotaro Murakami,Sinya Aoki,Takumi Doi,Yan Lyu,Wren Yamada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses lattice QCD and the HAL QCD method to analyze S-wave kaon-nucleon interactions, finding repulsive forces at short distances and no evidence for the Θ+(1540) pentaquark. The results are partially consistent with experimental data for I=1, while I=0 channel results suggest P-wave dominance over S-wave.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate S-wave kaon-nucleon (KN) interactions with strangeness S=+1 using lattice QCD, aiming to understand the nature of the interaction and search for any resonances or bound states, such as the Θ+(1540) pentaquark.

Method: The researchers used the time-dependent HAL QCD method on a (2+1)-flavor gauge configuration with specific meson masses to calculate the KN potentials, phase shifts, scattering lengths, and cross sections for both isospin channels (I=1 and I=0).

Result: The potentials showed repulsion at short distances, with a small attractive pocket only in the I=0 channel. No resonances or bound states were found, suggesting the absence of the Θ+(1540) pentaquark. Scattering lengths and cross-sections were calculated, with mixed consistency with experimental data for I=1 and an indication that the I=0 channel is dominated by P-wave components.

Conclusion: The analysis of S-wave KN interactions did not find evidence supporting the existence of the Θ+(1540) pentaquark. The results for the I=1 channel are somewhat consistent with experimental data, while the I=0 channel's S-wave contribution appears to be less significant compared to the P-wave.

Abstract: We investigate S-wave kaon-nucleon ($KN$) interactions with strangeness
$S=+1$ in lattice QCD using the time-dependent HAL QCD method. Employing
$(2+1)$-flavor gauge configuration with $m_{\pi}\approx 137~\textrm{MeV}$ and
$m_{K}\approx 502~\textrm{MeV}$, we calculate the $KN$ potentials at the
leading order in the derivative expansion. The potentials in both isospin
channels ($I=1$ and $I=0$) exhibit repulsion at short distances, while only the
$I=0$ potential has a small attractive pocket at intermediate distances. The
phase shifts computed from these potentials show no signals corresponding to
resonances or bound states in both isospin channels, suggesting the absence of
the $\Theta^{+}(1540)$ pentaquark in the S-wave $KN$ systems. The scattering
lengths result in $a^{I=1}_{0} = -0.226(5)(^{+5}_{-0})~\textrm{fm}$ and
$a^{I=0}_{0} = +0.031(62)(^{+0}_{-29})~\textrm{fm}$. Our results of the S-wave
cross sections for $I=1$ are consistent with some of the experimental data
within $2-3$ $\sigma$, while they deviate from others. The results for $I=0$,
combined with recent studies on chiral perturbation theory, suggest that the
scattering amplitudes in this channel are dominated by P-wave components rather
than S-wave.

### [3] [Tensor renormalization group approach to entanglement entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02185)
*Takahiro Hayazaki,Daisuke Kadoh,Shinji Takeda,Gota Tanaka*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A method to compute entanglement entropy using tensor renormalization group, tested on the Ising model, shows high accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a new approach for computing the entanglement entropy (EE) of quantum systems, which is an important quantity in quantum information theory and condensed matter physics, by leveraging the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. This aims to provide a more efficient and accurate way to calculate EE, especially for large or complex systems.

Method: The researchers represent the reduced density matrix of a d-dimensional quantum system as a (d+1)-dimensional tensor network and devise an explicit algorithm for d=1, allowing the calculation of EE for single-interval subsystems of any size. The method is then applied to a two-dimensional tensor network of the Ising model to test its efficacy.

Result: The central charge c is calculated with a value of 0.49997(8) at D=96, which is in close agreement with the theoretical prediction, indicating that the proposed method can accurately and reliably compute the entanglement entropy of the system under study.

Conclusion: The proposed method for calculating entanglement entropy through the tensor renormalization group technique is shown to be both accurate and reliable, as evidenced by the successful application to the Ising model. This suggests the potential for the method to be used in further studies of quantum systems and their entanglement properties.

Abstract: We propose a method to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) using the tensor
renormalization group (TRG) method. The reduced density matrix of a
$d$-dimensional quantum system is represented as a $(d+1)$-dimensional tensor
network. We develop an explicit algorithm for $d=1$ that enables the
calculation of EE for single-interval subsystems of arbitrary size. We test our
method in two-dimensional tensor network of the Ising model. The central charge
is obtained as $c=0.49997(8)$ for $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical
prediction within an error, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our
proposed method.

### [4] [Fermion Discretization Effects in the Two-Flavor Lattice Schwinger Model: A Study with Matrix Product States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02329)
*Tim Schwägerl,Karl Jansen,Stefan Kühn*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper conducts a detailed tensor network study of different fermion types in the Hamiltonian formulation, using the two-flavor Schwinger model. It particularly focuses on twisted mass fermions, demonstrating their O(a) improvement and milder volume dependence compared to other discretizations. The results support the use of twisted mass fermions for future higher-dimensional lattice gauge theory simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore the properties of twisted mass fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation, which had not been thoroughly investigated before, and to compare their performance with staggered and Wilson fermions, especially in terms of O(a) improvement and finite-volume effects.

Method: A tensor network approach is used to study staggered, Wilson, and twisted mass fermions within the massive two-flavor Schwinger model. An electric-field-based method is applied for mass renormalization, and two methods are employed to address finite-volume effects: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume scaling.

Result: The study confirms the expected O(a) improvement for twisted mass fermions in both free and interacting theories. The pion mass shows rapid convergence to the continuum limit after including mass renormalization. Twisted mass fermions exhibit milder volume dependence and clear isospin-breaking effects, indicating potential advantages for Hamiltonian simulations.

Conclusion: Twisted mass fermions offer significant benefits, such as O(a) improvement and reduced finite-volume effects, making them a promising choice for Hamiltonian simulations. These findings encourage further investigation into their application in more complex, higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive tensor network study of staggered, Wilson, and
twisted mass fermions in the Hamiltonian formulation, using the massive
two-flavor Schwinger model as a benchmark. Particular emphasis is placed on
twisted mass fermions, whose properties in this context have not been
systematically explored before. We confirm the expected O(a) improvement in the
free theory and observe that this improvement persists in the interacting case.
By leveraging an electric-field-based method for mass renormalization, we
reliably tune to maximal twist and establish the method's applicability in the
two-flavor model. Once mass renormalization is included, the pion mass exhibits
rapid convergence to the continuum limit. Finite-volume effects are addressed
using two complementary approaches: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume
scaling. Our results show excellent agreement with semiclassical predictions
and reveal a milder volume dependence for twisted mass fermions compared to
staggered and Wilson discretizations. In addition, we observe clear
isospin-breaking effects, suggesting intriguing parallels with lattice QCD.
These findings highlight the advantages of twisted mass fermions for
Hamiltonian simulations and motivate their further exploration, particularly in
view of future applications to higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.

### [5] [Gradient flow for parton distribution functions: first application to the pion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02472)
*Anthony Francis,Patrick Fritzsch,Robert V. Harlander,Rohith Karur,Jangho Kim,Jonas T. Kohnen,Giovanni Pederiva,Dimitra A. Pefkou,Antonio Rago,Andrea Shindler,André Walker-Loud,Savvas Zafeiropoulos*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new method using gradient flow overcomes the challenges of computing higher Mellin moments of parton distribution functions (PDFs) on the lattice, enabling accurate calculations up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$ for pion PDFs at a specific pion mass, with results consistent with recent phenomenological studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the computation of Mellin moments of parton distribution functions (PDFs) beyond the lowest order, which has been hindered by reduced hypercubic symmetry when using local operators on the lattice. A new approach that utilizes gradient flow is proposed to address these limitations and extend the calculation to higher moments.

Method: The method involves employing gradient flow in the lattice QCD framework to compute higher Mellin moments of flavor non-singlet pion PDFs. This technique is applied across four different lattice spacings, with the pion mass set around 411 MeV, allowing for the determination of moments up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$.

Result: The study successfully computes the ratios of flavor non-singlet pion PDF moments up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$, demonstrating the effectiveness of the gradient flow method. The computed moments and the reconstructed PDF are found to be in quantitative agreement with those from recent phenomenological extractions.

Conclusion: The use of gradient flow in the lattice QCD framework effectively resolves the issues associated with reduced hypercubic symmetry, thus enabling the precise computation of higher Mellin moments of pion PDFs. The consistency of the results with phenomenological data supports the validity and potential of this novel approach.

Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are central to precision QCD
phenomenology. Their Mellin moments can be computed on the lattice, but direct
determinations using local operators, besides $\langle x \rangle$, face severe
challenges from reduced hypercubic symmetry, limiting results to the lowest
moments. A recently proposed method resolves these issues using gradient flow.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by computing ratios of flavor
non-singlet pion PDF moments up to $\langle x^5 \rangle$, on four lattice
spacings at $m_\pi \simeq 411$ MeV. The moments and reconstructed PDF agree
quantitatively with recent phenomenological extractions.
