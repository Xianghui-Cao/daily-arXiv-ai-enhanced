*Octavio Vega,Javad Komijani,Aida El-Khadra,Marina Marinkovic*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of symmetry-preserving diffusion models as a more efficient alternative to MCMC for sampling in lattice quantum field theories, showing improved performance in sample quality, expressivity, and effective sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of MCMC simulations near the critical point in LQFT due to critical slowing down, by proposing an alternative method that maintains or improves upon the quality and efficiency of the samples generated.

Method: The authors develop score networks that are designed to be equivariant under various group transformations relevant to the field theories being studied. These networks are trained using an augmented scheme that enhances the quality of the samples produced.

Result: The results show that the proposed symmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks across several metrics, including sample quality, expressivity, and the effective sample size, particularly in the context of two-dimensional $\phi^4$ and ${\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories.

Conclusion: The study concludes that symmetry-preserving diffusion models offer a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of MCMC in LQFT, with demonstrated improvements in key aspects of the simulation process.

Abstract: Near the critical point, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of
lattice quantum field theories (LQFT) become increasingly inefficient due to
critical slowing down. In this work, we investigate score-based
symmetry-preserving diffusion models as an alternative strategy to sample
two-dimensional $\phi^4$ and ${\rm U}(1)$ lattice field theories. We develop
score networks that are equivariant to a range of group transformations,
including global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflections, local ${\rm U}(1)$ rotations, and
periodic translations $\mathbb{T}$. The score networks are trained using an
augmented training scheme, which significantly improves sample quality in the
simulated field theories. We also demonstrate empirically that our
symmetry-aware models outperform generic score networks in sample quality,
expressivity, and effective sample size.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new, highly optimized code for simulating nucleon interactions on supercomputers, achieving up to 240 times speed-up compared to the previous state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the delicate balance of nucleon interaction strength and its impact on the universe's hydrogen content, which is central to our existence, by varying the parameters of nature in simulations.

Method: Development of a new code with advanced physics algorithms and a highly optimized library for CPU-GPU parallel architecture simulations. The code was tested on multiple supercomputers, including El Capitan, for weak and linear scaling performance.

Result: The developed code demonstrated excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling, achieving a disruptive speed-up of approximately 240 times over the previous state-of-the-art on several supercomputers.

Conclusion: The introduction of this new code marks a significant advancement in supercomputing, enabling more efficient and faster simulations of nucleon interactions, which are crucial for understanding the development of the universe and nuclear phenomena.

Abstract: The vast majority of visible matter in our universe comes from protons and
neutrons (the nucleons). Nucleon interactions are fundamental to how the
universe developed after the Big Bang and govern all nuclear phenomena. The
subtle balance in how two nucleons interact shapes the universe's hydrogen
content that is central to our existence. Our objective is to compute the
interaction strength while varying the parameters of nature to understand how
delicate this balance is. We developed a new code using sophisticated physics
algorithms and a highly optimized library for simulations on CPU-GPU parallel
architectures. It has excellent weak scaling and impressive linear scaling for
a fixed problem size with increasing number of nodes up to El Capitan's full
$\sim$11,000 nodes. On Alps, El Capitan, Frontier, Jupiter, and Perlmutter
supercomputers we achieve a maximum disruptive speed-up of $\sim$240 times the
previous state-of-the-art, signaling a new era of supercomputing.

*Chen Chen,Hongxin Dong,Liuming Liu,Peng Sun,Xiaonu Xiong,Yi-Bo Yang,Fei Yao,Jian-Hui Zhang,Chunhua Zeng,Shiyi Zhong*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function has been performed, using large-momentum effective theory on 2+1 flavor CLS ensembles with three different lattice spacings and a pion mass around 300 MeV. The study employs distillation, hybrid renormalization, and one-loop perturbative matching, and the results after extrapolation to the continuum and infinite momentum limit are consistent with global analysis outcomes within error margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a precise lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculation for the nucleon's gluon parton distribution function, which is crucial for understanding the structure of protons and neutrons. By employing advanced techniques, the researchers aim to achieve a high-accuracy result that can be compared with those from global analysis, thereby contributing to the validation and refinement of QCD models.

Method: The method involves the use of large-momentum effective theory in a lattice QCD framework, utilizing 2+1 flavor CLS ensembles with varying lattice spacings and a fixed pion mass. To improve the signal quality, the distillation technique is used. The calculation further incorporates state-of-the-art hybrid renormalization and one-loop perturbative matching, followed by an extrapolation to the continuum and infinite momentum limit.

Result: The result of the lattice QCD calculation for the nucleon's gluon parton distribution function, after applying the necessary renormalization, matching, and extrapolation, is found to be in agreement with the results from global analysis within the associated uncertainties. This indicates a successful implementation of the theoretical and computational methods, and supports the reliability of the lattice QCD approach in this context.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations, when combined with large-momentum effective theory and advanced computational techniques, can produce reliable results for the nucleon's gluon parton distribution function. These findings are consistent with global analysis, suggesting that the current lattice QCD methodology is valid and can contribute to a deeper understanding of nucleon structure.

Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon gluon
parton distribution function employing large-momentum effective theory. The
calculation is carried out on the 2+1 flavour CLQCD ensembles with three
lattice spacings a={0.105,0.0897,0.0775} fm and pion mass of approximately 300
MeV, covering nulceon momenta up to 1.97 GeV. Distillation technique is applied
to improve the signal of two-point correlators. We then apply the
state-of-the-art hybrid renormalization and one-loop perturbative matching, and
extrapolate the result to the continuum and infinite momentum limit. Our result
is in agreement with that from global analysis within errors.

### [4] [Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26455)
*Szabolcs Borsányi,Zoltán Fodor,Jana N. Guenther,Piyush Kumar,Paolo Parotto,Attila Pásztor,Chik Him Wong*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase diagram of QCD at high density using lattice simulations with imaginary baryon chemical potential, finding that strangeness neutrality conditions lead to constant values for strangeness chemical potential and susceptibility. These constants are used as proxies for the QCD crossover, which show minimal influence from criticality and finite volume effects. The authors present new data and extrapolate these constants to a finite baryon chemical potential, up to 400 MeV, and find agreement with existing chiral transition results and HRG model predictions. Higher-order expansions on smaller lattices suggest the crossover line may deviate from the freeze-out line around 500 MeV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the complex action problem in lattice QCD simulations at large baryon density, and to map out the QCD phase diagram, particularly the location of the crossover at non-zero baryon chemical potential.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential, with the imposition of strangeness neutrality. The authors use a Taylor expansion method to extrapolate the strangeness chemical potential and strangeness susceptibility to real, finite baryon chemical potentials, and compare the results with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model predictions.

Result: The authors find that the strangeness chemical potential and strangeness susceptibility can be used as stable proxies for the QCD crossover, with their values remaining constant at the chiral transition. The continuum limits of these quantities agree well with the chiral transition and HRG model results. Higher-order expansions on a smaller lattice size indicate that the crossover line begins to diverge from the freeze-out line near 500 MeV baryon chemical potential.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the strangeness neutrality condition leads to robust indicators for the QCD crossover, and that the crossover line may start to separate from the freeze-out line at approximately 500 MeV, aligning with theoretical expectations.

Abstract: Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density
is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations.
Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ we observe
that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness
chemical potential $\mu_S/\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\chi_2^S$
take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\mu_B$. We
present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\mu_S/\mu_B$ or
$\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good
proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly
influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum
limits for these proxies up to $\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a
next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on
large-statistics data on $16^3 \times 8$, $20^3 \times 10$ and $24^3 \times 12$
lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in
excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and,
strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas
(HRG) model. On the $16^3 \times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the
extrapolation beyond $\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the
HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy
starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $\mu_B\approx500$ MeV,
as expected but not yet observed.

### [5] [Position-space sampling for local multiquark operators in lattice QCD using distillation and the importance of tetraquark operators for $T_{cc}(3875)^+$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26459)
*Andres Stump,Jeremy R. Green*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a position-space sampling method within the distillation framework to reduce computational costs for local multiquark operators, demonstrating its efficiency and impact on the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of using local multiquark operators with four or more (anti)quarks in lattice QCD spectroscopy calculations, particularly when employing the distillation method. The aim is to make the process more efficient by reducing the scaling of the computational cost.

Method: A position-space sampling method is developed within the distillation approach, which performs momentum projection over sparse grids instead of the full spatial lattice, thereby reducing the cost of contractions. This method is applied to single-meson, single-baryon, and local tetraquark operators, and an extended basis including local tetraquark operators is used to study the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum.

Result: The new method significantly reduces the computational cost and demonstrates efficiency for the types of operators tested. The inclusion of local tetraquark operators in the basis leads to significant shifts in several energy levels of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum, which also affects the $DD^*$ scattering phase shift as analyzed through L"uscher's method.

Conclusion: The position-space sampling method within distillation is an effective approach to decrease the computational expense of working with local multiquark operators. It allows for a more comprehensive operator basis, which can lead to important changes in the spectrum and scattering phase shifts, improving the accuracy and scope of lattice QCD spectroscopy studies.

Abstract: Obtaining hadronic two-point functions is a central step in spectroscopy
calculations in lattice QCD. This requires solving the Dirac equation
repeatedly, which is computationally demanding. The distillation method
addresses this difficulty by using the lowest eigenvectors of the spatial
Laplacian to construct a subspace in which the Dirac operator can be fully
inverted. This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson
and baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or
more (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of
contractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors.
We present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces
this cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids
rather than the full spatial lattice. We demonstrate the efficiency of this
unbiased estimator for single-meson, single-baryon and local tetraquark
operators. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point,
we apply this method to study the importance of local tetraquark operators for
the finite-volume $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ spectrum. To this end, we extend a large
basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators by including local
tetraquark operators. The inclusion of local operators leads to significant
shifts in several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on
the $DD^*$ scattering phase shift from a single-channel $s$-wave L\"uscher
analysis.

### [6] [Generative sampling with physics-informed kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26678)
*Friederike Ihssen,Renzo Kapust,Jan M. Pawlowski*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel generative network architecture for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories is introduced, which uses independent layerwise learning and physics-informed renormalisation group flows to solve linear differential equations, enabling iterative refinement of transformation kernels and better handling of out-of-domain problems. The method's practicality is demonstrated through simulations in scalar field theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to develop a more efficient and effective generographic network for Monte-Carlo sampling in the context of lattice field theories. The authors aim to improve upon existing methods by introducing an architecture that can handle out-of-domain issues and allow for further optimization through the use of physics-informed principles.

Method: The authors propose a generative network architecture that employs independent layerwise learning and utilizes physics-informed renormalisation group (RG) flows. These RG flows are represented as first-order partial differential equations, which describe the transformation from one layer to the next. By solving these equations, the kernels of the transformations are obtained and can be iteratively refined, allowing for the generation of samples that are consistent with the underlying physics of the system.

Result: The proposed architecture is shown to be practically feasible through its application in scalar field theory simulations. The results indicate that the method can effectively generate samples and has the potential to address out-of-domain problems typically faced by generative models, suggesting that it could lead to improvements in accuracy and efficiency over traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the new generative network, which leverages physics-informed RG flows and independent layerwise learning, is a promising approach for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories. It offers a way to tackle out-of-domain challenges and paves the way for further optimization, as evidenced by the successful demonstration in scalar field theory simulations.

Abstract: We construct a generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field
theories and beyond, for which the learning of layerwise propagation is done
and optimised independently on each layer. The architecture uses
physics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the
layerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple
first order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation
group kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task
into that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential
equations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are
analytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to
structurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative
models and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical
feasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories.

### [7] [Moments of parton distributions functions of the pion from lattice QCD using gradient flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26738)
*Anthony Francis,Patrick Fritzsch,Rohith Karur,Jangho Kim,Giovanni Pederiva,Dimitra A. Pefkou,Antonio Rago,Andrea Shindler,André Walker-Loud,Savvas Zafeiropoulos*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a nonperturbative method to determine pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios using the gradient flow in lattice QCD, with results consistent with phenomenological expectations and competitive uncertainties. The method is shown to be efficient and systematically improvable for accessing partonic quantities from first principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop and test an efficient and systematically improvable method for determining the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios through the use of the gradient flow in lattice QCD, which can provide insights into partonic quantities from first principles.

Method: The authors employ SU(3) isosymmetric gauge configurations with a pseudoscalar mass close to 411 MeV, using four different lattice spacings and a nonperturbatively improved action. They perform a continuum extrapolation and match the results to the MS-bar scheme at 2 GeV, while also controlling the limit of vanishing flow time.

Result: The results show that the flowed PDF moment ratios exhibit O(a^2) scaling across ensembles and have only mild residual flow-time dependence after continuum extrapolation. The computed ratios are consistent with phenomenological expectations and have statistical uncertainties comparable to modern global fits.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the gradient flow approach provides an efficient and systematically improvable way to access partonic quantities, such as the pion's valence PDFs, and sets the stage for future work targeting lighter pion masses and nucleon structure studies.

Abstract: We present a nonperturbative determination of the pion valence parton
distribution function (PDF) moment ratios $\left\langle x^{n-1} \right\rangle /
\left\langle x \right\rangle$ up to $n=6$, using the gradient flow in lattice
QCD. As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations
generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_\pi \simeq
411~\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a
nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum
extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\to0$. The flowed ratios
exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated
results, matched to the $\overline {\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV using
next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual
flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small
number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for
the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are
competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the
gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to
access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this
work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and
applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and
sea-quark distributions.
