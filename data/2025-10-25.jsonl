The sea sector is based on gauge\nensembles with $N_{\\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved\nWilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)\ninitiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five\nvalues of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the\nphysical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ\nWilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless\nWilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the\nstrategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses\nalong the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is\nthen conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action\napproach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion\nregularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,\nwe conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the\nmasses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow\nscale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct\nways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their\ncombination. We observe that the latter combination results in enhanced control\nof the systematic uncertainties, thereby yielding a precise determination of\nthe physical value of $t_0$."}
