Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics of flux strings in a 2+1D SU(2) Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter using tensor network methods, revealing non-Abelian features such as Casimir reduction, baryon blockade, and representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances, which are important for future quantum simulations.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) and more complex non-Abelian LGTs, providing insights into quark confinement and hadronization that can guide the development of upcoming quantum simulators.

Method: Utilizing tensor network methods to simulate real-time string dynamics in a 2+1D SU(2) Yang-Mills LGT, including the study of string breaking, meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, and non-Abelian fluctuations at various conditions.

Result: String breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction and particle formation, with a baryon blockade delaying string breaking at finite baryon density. Non-Abelian fluctuations include glueball loops and self-crossed strings, and higher-energy strings show representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances.

Conclusion: The findings highlight distinctively non-Abelian phenomena in the 2+1D SU(2) Yang-Mills LGT, which are crucial for the design and interpretation of future quantum simulation experiments of non-Abelian LGTs.

Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement
and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have
mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the
advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to
bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one
spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time
string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.
In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through
sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a
distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a
\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from
resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball
loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with
distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover
representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a
guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical precision extrapolation method to achieve high-precision ξ-gauge fixing in Lattice QCD, which is validated by reproducing ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators with a 0.2% accuracy up to ξ ~ 1.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the significant challenges in achieving high-precision ξ-gauge fixing on the lattice, which has limited the application of Lattice QCD to off-shell partons primarily to the Landau gauge. The authors are inspired by the universal power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing precision in the Landau gauge and seek to extend this to ξ-gauge.

Method: The method proposed in the paper involves an empirical precision extrapolation approach that approximates high-precision ξ-gauge fixing. This is achieved by defining the bare gauge coupling appropriately and then determining the effective ξ, which allows for the validation of the ξ-gauge fixing procedure through the successful reproduction of ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants.

Result: The result of the study shows that the proposed method can reproduce the ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators with a high level of accuracy (0.2%) up to ξ values of approximately 1, thereby validating the effectiveness of the ξ-gauge fixing procedure.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the empirical precision extrapolation method is a valid approach to approximate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing in Lattice QCD, as it successfully reproduces the expected renormalization constants over a wide range of ξ values, thus opening up possibilities for more accurate calculations involving off-shell partons.

Abstract: Lattice QCD provides a first-principles framework for solving Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). However, its application to off-shell partons has been
largely restricted to the Landau gauge, as achieving high-precision $\xi$-gauge
fixing on the lattice poses significant challenges. Motivated by a universal
power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing
precision in the Landau gauge, we propose an empirical precision extrapolation
method to approximate high-precision $\xi$-gauge fixing. By properly defining
the bare gauge coupling and then the effective $\xi$, we validate our
$\xi$-gauge fixing procedure by successfully reproducing the $\xi$-dependent
RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2\%
level, up to $\xi \sim 1$.
