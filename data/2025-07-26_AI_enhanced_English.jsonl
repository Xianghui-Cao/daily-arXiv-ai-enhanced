Using\nthe formalism developed in Ref.~\\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of\nsynthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is\ndemonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\\\"uscher approach, the\ntruncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final\nresult. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified\nL\\\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising\nwithin the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization\nscheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range\nexpansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new numerical algorithm for the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function is introduced, which shows minimal impact from truncating higher partial waves. The paper also discusses regularization and renormalization, presenting a scheme that yields naturally sized effective range expansion parameters across all partial waves.", "motivation": "The motivation of this paper is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm for calculating the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function in scenarios involving long-range forces, while addressing the issues of truncation, regularization, and renormalization that arise with the standard L\u00fcscher approach.", "method": "The method involves using the formalism from a referenced study to analyze synthetic data on finite-volume energy levels in a simplified model. The authors then discuss the regularization and renormalization of the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function, and propose a new renormalization scheme to obtain natural-sized effective range parameters.", "result": "The results show that truncating higher partial waves has little effect on the final outcome when using the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the new renormalization scheme successfully produces effective range expansion parameters of natural size for all partial waves, even under cutoff regularization.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the newly developed numerical algorithm and renormalization scheme provide a robust and accurate method for calculating the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function, with improved handling of truncation and regularization issues compared to the traditional L\u00fcscher approach."}}
