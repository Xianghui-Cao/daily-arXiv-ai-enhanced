In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation\nvalues of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's\nSchwinger--Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation\nvalues are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in\nthe context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general\nprobability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on\na real manifold. We test these criteria in a few simple one- and\ntwo-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out\nincorrect results without the need of exact solutions."}
