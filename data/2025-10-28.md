TL;DR: The paper proposes baryon-electric charge correlations and the chemical potential ratio as probes for measuring the effects of strong magnetic fields on strongly interacting matter, using (2+1)-flavor QCD lattice simulations. It also explores the QCD equation of state under these conditions, revealing non-monotonic structures in thermodynamic coefficients.

Motivation: The motivation is to find a way to measure the impact of strong magnetic fields on the properties of strongly interacting matter, which are difficult to directly measure experimentally, especially in the context of heavy-ion collisions.

Method: The authors use (2+1)-flavor QCD lattice simulations at physical pion masses to investigate baryon-electric charge correlations and the chemical potential ratio. They also create proxies based on the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model and apply kinematic cuts to match experimental conditions of STAR and ALICE detectors. The study extends to examining the QCD equation of state and leading-order thermodynamic coefficients in strangeness-neutral scenarios with varying magnetic field strengths.

Result: The results show that along the transition line, the baryon-electric charge correlation and the chemical potential ratio increase significantly with the presence of a strong magnetic field. The investigation into the QCD equation of state reveals non-monotonic behaviors in the thermodynamic coefficients up to a magnetic field strength of 0.8 GeV^2.

Conclusion: The proposed probes, baryon-electric charge correlations and the chemical potential ratio, are sensitive to the magnetic field and could be used to indirectly measure its effect on the strongly interacting matter. The observed non-monotonic structures in the thermodynamic coefficients suggest complex behavior in the QCD equation of state under strong magnetic fields.

Abstract: Strong magnetic fields can profoundly affect the equilibrium properties,
characterized by the equation of state and bulk thermodynamics of strongly
interacting matter. Although such fields are expected in off-central heavy-ion
collisions, directly measuring their experimental imprints remains extremely
challenging. To address this, we propose the baryon-electric charge
correlations $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm
Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as magnetic-field-sensitive probes, based on (2+1)-flavor QCD
lattice simulations at physical pion masses. Along the transition line,
$\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb
collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$,
respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions and experimental observations,
we construct HRG-based proxies and apply systematic kinematic cuts to emulate
STAR and ALICE detector acceptances. Furthermore, we extend this investigation
to the QCD equation of state, and examine the leading-order thermodynamic
coefficients for strangeness-neutral scenarios up to $eB \simeq 0.8 {\rm GeV}^2
\sim 45 m_{\pi}^2$, revealing intriguing non-monotonic structures.
