Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper uses Monte Carlo simulations to study the mass spectrum of bosons in the electroweak model under a strong magnetic field, finding that the W boson's spin component aligned with the magnetic field is the lightest excitation and its mass changes across different phases.

Motivation: To understand the behavior of the electroweak vacuum and the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector when subjected to an extremely strong external magnetic field at zero temperature.

Method: Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were employed to analyze the electroweak model's bosonic sector mass spectrum under an external magnetic field of electroweak-scale strength (10^20 T).

Result: The W boson's spin component aligned with the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases, with its mass decreasing in the low-field phase, becoming very small in the intermediate vortex phase, and rising again in the high-field symmetry-restored phase. The Higgs and Z boson masses do not vanish in any phase or during transitions.

Conclusion: The nearly massless excitation of the W boson in the intermediate vortex phase corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode, which is associated with the vibrations of the electroweak vortex lattice. This finding provides insight into the dynamics of the electroweak theory under extreme conditions.

Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.

### [2] [Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14967)
*Heng-Tong Ding,Hai-Tao Shu,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses lattice QCD to analyze the temperature dependence of shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma, finding that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio has a minimum near the transition temperature, while the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio decreases with increasing temperature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the gluon plasma's shear and bulk viscosities over a range of temperatures, including the transition region, by employing precise lattice QCD calculations and model-based spectral analysis.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations were performed on large, fine lattices at various temperatures, using gradient flow and a blocking technique for high precision. The energy-momentum tensor correlators were analyzed, and viscosities were extracted by fitting spectral functions, with particular attention to modeling uncertainties in the transport-peak width.

Result: The research found that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s) has a minimum value near the transition temperature Tc and increases as the temperature rises above Tc. Conversely, the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio (ζ/s) shows a monotonic decrease over the entire temperature range examined.

Conclusion: The temperature-dependent behavior of the gluon plasma's viscosities was elucidated, indicating a non-monotonic trend for η/s and a decreasing trend for ζ/s, which provides insight into the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma near and above the deconfinement transition.

Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity ($η$) and bulk viscosity ($ζ$) of the gluon plasma using lattice QCD over the range 0.76--2.25 $T_c$, extending from below the transition temperature $T_c$ across the transition region and into the deconfined phase. At each temperature, we employ three large, fine lattices, which enables controlled continuum extrapolations of the energy-momentum tensor correlators. Using gradient flow together with a recently developed blocking technique, we achieve percent level precision for these correlators, providing strong constraints for a model-based spectral analysis. Since the inversion to real-time information is intrinsically ill posed, we extract viscosities by fitting spectral functions whose ultraviolet behavior is matched to the best available perturbative result, while the infrared region is described by a Lorentzian transport peak. The dominant modeling uncertainty associated with the transport-peak width is bracketed by varying it over a physically motivated range set by thermal scales. We find that the shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $η/s$, exhibits a minimum near the transition temperature $T_c$ and increases for $T>T_c$, whereas the bulk-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio, $ζ/s$, decreases monotonically over the entire temperature range studied.
