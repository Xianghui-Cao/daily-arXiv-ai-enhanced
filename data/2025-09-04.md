Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in charmed hadron physics, driven
by numerous experimental discoveries of exotic states such as $T^+_{cc}$ and
$P_c$. These findings have highlighted the importance of understanding charmed
hadron interactions. With significant advances in theory and computation,
lattice QCD has become a reliable tool for studying nonperturbative dynamics of
low-energy QCD. In this talk, I review recent lattice QCD studies of charmed
hadron interactions, focusing on three representative systems: $D^*$-$D$,
$N$-$c\bar c$, and $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$.

### [2] [From deconfinement to nuclear matter: mean-field approaches for effective Polyakov loop theories of lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03172)
*Christoph Konrad,Owe Philipsen*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the application of three mean-field approximations to effective Polyakov loop theories, derived from lattice QCD, to study the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential. It finds a first-order nuclear liquid-gas transition with a critical end point for very low temperatures and moderately heavy quarks, and suggests that the phase diagram can be determined qualitatively using analytical methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the sign problem in numerical studies of the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential on the lattice, by applying mean-field approximations to effective theories that are more tractable and have a less severe sign problem.

Method: Three mean-field approximations are applied to effective Polyakov loop theories, which incorporate local fluctuations to varying degrees. The predictions of these approximations are compared against Monte Carlo results for deconfinement and baryon onset transitions.

Result: A first-order nuclear liquid-gas transition with a critical end point is found for very low temperatures and moderately heavy quarks. The location of critical end points influenced by fluctuations is not accurate, but the overall phase diagram can still be determined qualitatively with analytical approaches.

Conclusion: Analytical methods, despite their limitations in predicting the exact location of critical end points, can provide a qualitative determination of the QCD phase diagram for heavy quarks at finite baryon chemical potential.

Abstract: Numerical studies of the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon chemical
potential $\mu_B$ on the lattice are impeded by a sign problem. Effective
Polyakov loop theories derived from lattice QCD via combined strong-coupling
and hopping expansions are valid for heavy quarks only, but tractable with a
significantly less severe sign problem. In this work, we apply three mean-field
approximations to these effective theories, each incorporating local
fluctuations to different degrees. We compare their predictions against Monte
Carlo results for the deconfinement transition at high temperatures and for the
baryon onset transition at low temperatures. In agreement with earlier
effective theory simulations, we find a first-order nuclear liquid-gas
transition with a critical end point for very low temperatures and moderately
heavy quarks. While the location of fluctuation-dominated critical end points
is expectedly inaccurate, the phase diagram of lattice QCD with heavy quarks
can be determined qualitatively with entirely analytical methods.

### [3] [Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509)
*Ivan Horváth*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories through quark and gluon scalar densities, presenting a formula for the gluon condensate <F^2> that shows it as a UV quantity. It also discusses the implications for an IR phase where the <F^2> contribution vanishes, suggesting scale invariance of the glue. The work defines IR decoupling of glue as an indicator of the IR phase transition and expresses the effective action of QCD via Dirac spectral density.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks by analyzing quark and gluon scalar densities, and to explore the nature of the recently discovered IR phase where IR degrees of freedom become independent of the system's bulk.

Method: A theoretical approach is taken to derive a formula for the gluon condensate <F^2> using the spectral density of Dirac modes, similar to the known decomposition for the quark condensate <ψψ>. The method also involves defining the IR decoupling of glue and expressing the effective action of full QCD via Dirac spectral density using coherent lattice QCD.

Result: The formula for the gluon condensate <F^2> reveals that it is a strictly UV quantity, and for the IR phase, the <F^2> contribution from the IR part is found to vanish, implying scale invariance of the glue. The IR decoupling of glue is proposed as an alternative indicator for the IR phase transition, and the effective action of QCD is successfully expressed entirely via Dirac spectral density.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the gluon condensate <F^2> does not contribute to the scale anomaly in the IR phase, which is consistent with the notion of scale invariance. The IR decoupling of glue is suggested as a new way to signal the IR phase transition, and the use of Dirac spectral density provides a novel expression for the effective action of full QCD.

Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and
$\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in
SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle
\bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density
$\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2
\rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For
the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom
separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that
$\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't
contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale
invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us
to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of
IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we
express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.
