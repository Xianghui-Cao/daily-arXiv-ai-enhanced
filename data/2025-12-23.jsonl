In recent years, significant progress has been achieved by exploiting systematic variations of theory parameters in regimes free of the sign problem. In this work, the idea of a follow-up investigation that extends a previous study at zero chemical potential is presented. A concrete programme for such an extension is discussed, outlining the required numerical steps, from data production to final analysis, and pointing to all the software tools that have been released to support these studies."}

By comparing our results to those from different actions and a $2+1$-flavor case, we find that the fermion action has the major impact, but the gauge action and charm quark loops also contribute significantly."}

The results obtained are based on a combination of a Wilson unitary action and the mixed-action setup introduced in arXiv:2309.14154, arXiv:2510.20450. The combination of the two regularisations enables a more precise control over the continuum-limit extrapolation."}

We quantify the complexity of the target distribution via the KL divergence between the magnetization distribution and a reference Gaussian distribution, and observe that configurations with smaller KL divergence typically require fewer training steps. Motivated by this observation, we investigate transfer learning and show that fine-tuning models pretrained at a single value of $κ$ can reduce training time compared with training from a Gaussian field. In addition, inspired by single-site and cluster Monte Carlo updates, we introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates on top of VAN proposals. These MH corrections systematically reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling in the parameter range we study, while maintaining high sampling efficiency in terms of the effective sample size (ESS). For both the Ising model and the $φ^4$ theory, our results agree with standard Monte Carlo benchmarks within errors, and no clear critical slowing down is observed in the explored parameter ranges."}

Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables."}

We work in $N_\\text{F}$-flavor QCD, keeping the heaviest quark massive and all others massless. The vacuum expectation values of these operators are calculated numerically through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD, providing important input for the extraction of fundamental QCD parameters from lattice calculations. While the focus is on charm- and bottom-quark mass effects, we provide the results in a form that is independent of the specific quark mass."}
