Abstract: We present a systematic lattice calculation of the $D_s \to \phi \ell
\nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay using (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion
configurations generated by the CLQCD collaboration. Seven gauge ensembles with
different lattice spacings, from $0.052~\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\text{fm}$, and
different pion masses, from about $210~\text{MeV}$ to $320~\text{MeV}$ are
utilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass
extrapolation. The ratios of form factors are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$
and $r_2=0.741(31)$, with the precision improved by up to an order of magnitude
compared to previous lattice studies. The branching fractions are given as
$\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi e\nu_e)=2.493(66)_{\text{stat}}(31)_{|V_{cs}|}\times
10^{-2}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi\mu\nu_\mu)=2.351(60)_{\text{stat}}(29)_{|V_{cs}|}\times
10^{-2}$. The corresponding ratio of the branching fractions between the lepton
$\mu$ and $e$ is given by $\mathcal{R}_{\mu/e}=0.9432(13)$, which provides
essential theoretical support for future high-precision experimental tests of
the lepton flavor universality. The CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also
extracted to be $0.952(12)_{\text{stat}}(23)_{\text{PDG}}$ and
$0.945(12)_{\text{stat}}(24)_{\text{PDG}}$ for the $\mu$ and $e$ channels,
respectively.
