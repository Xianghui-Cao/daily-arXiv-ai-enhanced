Thanks to this algorithm I am able to\nexplore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to\nprecisely determine $\\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous\nstudies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum\nlimit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the\nindependence of the continuum limit of $\\chi$ from this choice. I conclude\nproviding a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous\ndeterminations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at\nfinite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit."}
