Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC\nensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four\nlattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators\nrealized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices\nwith carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state\nenergy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their\nbinding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy\nseparation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon\nthresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor\ndibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the\n$\\Omega_{ccc}$-$\\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state,\nwhile the $\\Omega$-$\\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it\ndifficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to\nbe unbound."}
