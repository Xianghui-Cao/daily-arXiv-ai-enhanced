Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a lattice-QCD determination of the Λ→p vector and axial-vector form factors, which are used to compute decay rates for electronic and muonic channels. The results provide a test of lepton-flavor universality and help in extracting the CKM matrix element |V_us| by combining with recent experimental data.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide theoretical input for studies of the semileptonic decay Λ→pℓν̅_ℓ and to offer a sensitive test of lepton-flavor universality as well as to extract the CKM matrix element |V_us| from the baryon sector using a theoretically well-controlled avenue.

Method: The method involves a lattice-QCD calculation on a single gauge ensemble with physical quark masses to determine the complete set of transition form factors, including second-class contributions. These form factors are then used to compute decay rates for both the electronic and muonic channels, and their ratio.

Result: The result is a precise determination of the Λ→p vector and axial-vector form factors, along with computed decay rates for the electronic and muonic channels, and an estimate of the CKM matrix element |V_us| obtained by combining the lattice-QCD results with recent measurements of the relevant branching fraction reported by BESIII and LHCb.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the lattice-QCD calculation provides a reliable means to study the semileptonic decay Λ→pℓν̅_ℓ, allowing for a sensitive test of lepton-flavor universality and offering a way to accurately extract the CKM matrix element |V_us|, which is important for testing the Standard Model of particle physics.

Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the $Λ\to p$ vector and axial-vector form factors, providing theoretical input for studies of the semileptonic decay $Λ\to p\ell\barν_\ell$. The calculation is carried out on a single gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and delivers a precise determination of the complete set of transition form factors, including second-class contributions.
  Using these form factors, we compute decay rates for both the electronic and muonic channels, as well as their ratio, which offers a sensitive test of lepton-flavor universality and possible non-standard scalar or tensor interactions.
  This decay mode provides a theoretically well-controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector.
  Our estimate of $|V_{us}|$ is obtained by combining our recent lattice-QCD results with recent measurements of the relevant branching fraction reported by BESIII and LHCb.
