Habibi", "Lingxiao Wang", "Kai Zhou"], "title": "Combining complex Langevin dynamics with score-based and energy-based diffusion models", "comment": "22 pages, many figures", "summary": "Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can\nsometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified\nconfiguration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled\nby this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to\nunderstand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or\ntheir log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to\nlearn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing\nscore-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the use of diffusion models from generative AI to learn and understand the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process in theories with a sign problem, comparing score-based and energy-based approaches.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding the probability distribution effectively sampled by the complex Langevin process in theories with a sign problem, which is not known beforehand and difficult to comprehend. The authors aim to leverage the capabilities of diffusion models, used in generative AI, for learning such distributions or their log derivatives from data, potentially opening up new applications.", "method": "The method involves applying and comparing two types of diffusion models - score-based and energy-based - to learn the distributions generated by a complex Langevin process. This approach aims to provide a novel way to tackle the sign problem in theoretical physics through the lens of machine learning, specifically using techniques from generative AI.", "result": "The results of the study are expected to shed light on the effectiveness of diffusion models in capturing the intricate probability distributions that arise from a complex Langevin process, offering insights into which type of diffusion model (score-based or energy-based) might be more suitable for this task. The exact outcomes, however, are not detailed in the abstract, indicating that the full paper would contain a thorough analysis and comparison.", "conclusion": "The conclusion likely discusses the potential of diffusion models as a tool for understanding and working with complex probability distributions in the context of theories suffering from a sign problem. It may also outline the advantages and limitations of each type of diffusion model explored and suggest future research directions, including practical applications in both theoretical physics and generative AI."}}
