TL;DR: The paper evaluates several methods, including Tikhonov regularization, Backus-Gilbert, Bayesian with GRW prior, and ANNs, to solve the inverse problem in L-IDFT of quasi-distributions. It finds that, except for the Backus-Gilbert method, all methods can reconstruct quasi-distributions, with Bayesian and ANNs providing more stable and accurate results. The choice of method should be based on the input data and a careful assessment of systematic uncertainties.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the inverse problem that arises in the limited inverse Fourier transform (L-IDFT) of quasi-distributions, which is crucial for obtaining reliable reconstructions of momentum space distributions from lattice QCD calculations.

Method: The authors use Tikhonov regularization, Backus-Gilbert method, Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) to evaluate their performance in reconstructing quasi-distributions. They compare these methods using both mock data from toy models and real lattice data, and also contrast them with a physics-driven λ-extrapolation approach.

Result: The study shows that, except for the Backus-Gilbert method, all other approaches can correctly reconstruct the quasi-distributions in momentum space, with the Bayesian approach and ANNs providing the most stable and accurate reconstructions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the L-IDFT represents a moderately tractable inverse problem and that selecting an appropriate reconstruction method, considering the input data and the potential systematic uncertainties, is critical for achieving reliable outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate several approaches to address the inverse problem that arises
in the limited inverse Fourier transform (L-IDFT) of quasi-distributions. The
methods explored include Tikhonov regularization, the Backus-Gilbert method,
the Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and the
feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). We evaluate the performance of
these methods using both mock data generated from toy models and real lattice
data from quasi distribution, and further compare them with the physics-driven
$\lambda$-extrapolation approach. Our results demonstrate that the L-IDFT
constitutes a moderately tractable inverse problem Except for the
Backus-Gilbert method, all the other approaches are capable of correctly
reconstructing the quasi-distributions in momentum space. In particular, the
Bayesian approach with GRW and the feedforward ANNs yield more stable and
accurate reconstructions. Based on these investigations, we conclude that, for
a given L-IDFT problem, selecting an appropriate reconstruction method
according to the input data and carefully assessing the potential systematic
uncertainties are essential for obtaining reliable results.
