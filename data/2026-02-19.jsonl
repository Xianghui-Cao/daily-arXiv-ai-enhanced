The calculation is carried out on a single gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and delivers a precise determination of the complete set of transition form factors, including second-class contributions.\n  Using these form factors, we compute decay rates for both the electronic and muonic channels, as well as their ratio, which offers a sensitive test of lepton-flavor universality and possible non-standard scalar or tensor interactions.\n  This decay mode provides a theoretically well-controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector.\n  Our estimate of $|V_{us}|$ is obtained by combining our recent lattice-QCD results with recent measurements of the relevant branching fraction reported by BESIII and LHCb."}
