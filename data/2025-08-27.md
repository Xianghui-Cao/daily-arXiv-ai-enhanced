*Alexei Bazavov,Yannis Trimis,Johannes Heinrich Weber*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the reconstruction of quarkonium spectral functions from thermal lattice correlators for Quark-Gluon Plasma studies, focusing on the generation of anisotropic HISQ ensembles and the tuning of gauge anisotropy, strange quark mass, and quark anisotropy. It also presents expressions for aHISQ fermion force for dynamical simulations.

Motivation: The motivation is to reconstruct quarkonium spectral functions from thermal lattice correlators, which are important for studying Quark-Gluon Plasma in heavy-ion collisions. The aim is to generate fully dynamical anisotropic HISQ (aHISQ) ensembles with a physical strange quark and a heavier-than-physical light quark mass.

Method: The method involves generating aHISQ ensembles and tuning the gauge anisotropy and lattice spacing using the gradient flow. The researchers also tune the strange quark mass and quark anisotropy, comparing various schemes and discussing pion taste splittings at different anisotropies. Additionally, they derive the necessary aHISQ fermion force for dynamical simulations.

Result: The results include the successful tuning of gauge anisotropy and lattice spacing, as well as the comparison of different tuning schemes for the strange quark mass and quark anisotropy. The team also examines pion taste splittings and provides the expressions needed for aHISQ fermion forces in future dynamical simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion would be that the project has made progress in the generation of aHISQ ensembles and the tuning of relevant parameters, providing a foundation for the reconstruction of quarkonium spectral functions and the study of Quark-Gluon Plasma. The derived aHISQ fermion forces are essential for carrying out further dynamical simulations.

Abstract: The primary goal of this project is the reconstruction of quarkonium spectral
functions from thermal lattice correlators, relevant for the study of
Quark-Gluon Plasma in heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we pursue the
generation of fully dynamical anisotropic HISQ (aHISQ) ensembles, aiming at a
physical strange quark and a heavier-than-physical light quark mass,
corresponding to a 300 MeV continuum pion mass. We report on tuning the gauge
anisotropy and the lattice spacing of anisotropic pure gauge ensembles with the
tree-level Symanzik-improved action using the gradient flow and compare various
tuning schemes. We also discuss the simultaneous tuning of the strange quark
mass and the quark anisotropy with aHISQ, using spectrum measurements on
quenched ensembles. We compare different ways to tune the quark anisotropy and
discuss pion taste splittings for aHISQ at anisotropies up to 8. Finally, we
present the expressions for the aHISQ fermion force required for dynamical
simulations.
