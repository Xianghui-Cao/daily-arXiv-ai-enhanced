Faria da Veiga", "Luiz A. Ferreira", "Henrique Malavazzi", "Ravi Mistry"], "title": "Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors", "comment": "30 pages", "summary": "We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and\nconserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice\nQCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the\nintegral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they\ncorrespond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the\ncharges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry\nthem. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of\nthose charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the\ngauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields.\nOur results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges\nare nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant\nstates, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges.\nWhile renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be\nanalyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant\ncharges and confinement."}

L\\\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to\nextract the scattering parameters in the effective range expansion, i.e., the\nscattering lengths and effective ranges, from the finite-volume spectra.

Hansen", "Fernando Romero-López", "Stephen R.

As in previous work using\nthe relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic\nlow-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that\nrelates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral\nequations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We\ndiscuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new\nfeatures that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin\nof the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a\nconcrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the\n$\\Delta$ resonance in the $N\\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and\n$1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\\pi$ states, and we do\nnot provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\\pi$ states\ncannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\\pi$\nscattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering\nusing the three-particle $DD\\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for\nall isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the\ngroundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\\pi\\pi \\leftrightarrow N\\pi$\nsystems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\\pi\\pi$\namplitudes arising from $N\\pi\\pi\\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our\nsubthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities."}
