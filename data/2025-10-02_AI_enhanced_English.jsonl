Concretely, we explore two different order\nparameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i)\nthe Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and\nconfinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator\nproposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper uses numerical simulations to study the phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields, employing two order parameters to distinguish between deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs phases.", "motivation": "The motivation is to re-examine the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature when coupled with Higgs fields, aiming to clearly differentiate between its three distinct phases using specific order parameters.", "method": "The method involves numerical simulation, focusing on two particular order parameters: the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator for differentiating between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases, and the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator for distinguishing between confinement and Higgs phases.", "result": "The result is an improved understanding and distinction of the three phases (deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs) within the (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory through the use of specified order parameters in numerical simulations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion suggests that the application of both the Fredenhagen-Marcu and Greensite-Matsuyama operators effectively distinguishes the deconfinement, confinement, and Higgs phases, providing a clearer picture of the phase structure in the presence of Higgs fields."}}
