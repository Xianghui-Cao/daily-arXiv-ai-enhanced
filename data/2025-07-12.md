TL;DR: The paper explores the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model using non-perturbative lattice calculations, showing spontaneous breaking of custodial symmetry and studying the spectrum, running of the gauge coupling, and finite temperature electroweak transition.

Motivation: The motivation is to study the enlarged scalar spectrum and the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry in the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which has the same global-symmetry properties as the standard model.

Method: Non-perturbative lattice calculations are used with energy cutoffs from 300 to 600 GeV, while maintaining a line of constant standard model physics by tuning bare couplings. The research examines the spectrum, the running of the gauge coupling, and the finite temperature electroweak transition.

Result: Spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry is observed within a certain region of the parameter space. The additional scalar states have realizable masses, with an estimated lower bound that is well below the W boson mass. The electroweak transition at finite temperatures shows a smooth crossover behavior.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into the dynamics of the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, indicating the presence of new physics with spontaneously broken custodial symmetry and the potential for light additional scalars. The results also suggest a smooth crossover during the electroweak phase transition.

Abstract: The $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which shares the same
global-symmetry properties with the standard model, is studied
non-perturbatively on the lattice. The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the
scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the
global symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous
breaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the
model. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling
are examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial
symmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300
to 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning
bare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$
bosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of
the $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are
explored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated
lower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and
independent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak
transition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing
properties of a smooth crossover behavior.
