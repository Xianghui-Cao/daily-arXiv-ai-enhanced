Contribution to the the XVIth Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum Conference (QCHSC24) 19-24 August, 2024 Cairns Convention Centre, Cairns, Queensland, Australia", "summary": "At large momentum transfer, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the form factor of the pion $F_π(Q^2)$ using lattice QCD simulations. Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_π(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_π(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \\;\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations."}

Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link. Costs in terms of qubit and gate number, and circuit depth, are found."}
