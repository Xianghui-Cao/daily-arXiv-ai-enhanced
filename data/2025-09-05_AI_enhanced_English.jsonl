We use a $24^3\\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an\ninverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\\infty$-based formalism.\nOur implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed\ndiagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision\non the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a\ndestructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the\ndecay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The\nprecision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical\ncontribution of the $\\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are\ntested and compared.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude for the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, achieving 25% statistical precision and identifying a destructive interference with the short-distance part.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a more accurate understanding of the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay by calculating the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude using lattice QCD, which has not been done before with this level of precision and detail.", "method": "The method involves using a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an inverse lattice spacing of 1.023 GeV, along with a QED$_\\infty$-based formalism, and implementing strategies for all five non-SU(3)-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies to compute the amplitude with 25% statistical precision.", "result": "A 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the long-distance amplitude was achieved, and it was found that there is a destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude. The precision of the results is limited by the reconstruction of the $\\eta$ intermediate state contribution, with various strategies tested and compared.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the study provides a first-principles determination of the long-distance amplitude's contribution to the $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, revealing a destructive interference with the short-distance part, and highlights the need for further refinement in the treatment of the $\\eta$ intermediate state to improve the precision of the results."}}
