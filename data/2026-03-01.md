### [1] [Interplay of Gauss Law and the fermion sign problem in quantum link models with dynamical matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22332)
*Pallabi Dey,Debasish Banerjee,Emilie Huffman*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores Quantum Link Models with dynamical matter and U(1) gauge fields in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, showing that the ground state is free from the fermion sign problem and can be effectively sampled using a meron cluster algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phases of Quantum Link Models, particularly the Coulomb phase and other confining phases, by investigating the ground state properties without a magnetic field and addressing the computational challenge posed by the fermion sign problem.

Method: The researchers used exact diagonalization techniques to analyze the ground state of the models and proved analytically that this particular sector is free of the fermion sign problem. They also utilized a meron cluster algorithm to sample the ground states of the Hamiltonian in the Gauss Law sector.

Result: The result is that the ground state of the model without a magnetic field lies in a specific sector (G_e, G_o) = (d, -d), which is free from the fermion sign problem, and the meron cluster algorithm is effective for sampling these ground states.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that in certain Quantum Link Models, the ground state does not suffer from the fermion sign problem, and an appropriate algorithm can efficiently capture the ground state properties, which is significant for simulating QED-like systems.

Abstract: Quantum Link Models with dynamical matter coupled to spin-$\frac{1}{2} \ \rm U(1)$ gauge fields in $d=2+1 $ and $3+1$ can potentially give rise to the Coulomb phase expected in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and other confining phases. Using exact diagonalization techniques, we show that the ground state in a class of models without the magnetic field always lies in the sector which satisfies $(G_e,G_o) = (d,\ -d)$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $e$ and $o$ are even and odd sites. It can be analytically proven that this sector is free of the fermion sign problem. We also demonstrate that a meron cluster algorithm for the problem naturally samples the ground states of the Hamiltonian in the aforementioned Gauss Law sector.

### [2] [The hadronic tensor from four-point functions on the lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22379)
*Christian Zimmermann,Terrence Draper,Jian Liang,Keh-Fei Liu,Raza Sabbir Sufian,Bigeng Wang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the calculation of the hadronic tensor, a key non-perturbative object in lepton-hadron interactions, using lattice QCD techniques. The authors extend previous work by considering a larger range of momentum transfers and use stochastic sources to compute four-point functions over a broad kinematic region, presenting preliminary results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the understanding of lepton-hadron interactions, such as neutrino-nucleon scattering, by calculating the hadronic tensor for a wider range of momentum transfers than previously achieved. This is important for the accurate description of structure functions which are essential in particle physics.

Method: The method involves the use of lattice QCD, specifically employing a clover fermion ensemble with a pion mass of 223 MeV and a lattice spacing of 0.085 fm. Stochastic sources are used to calculate the required four-point functions across a broad kinematic region, enabling the reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space.

Result: Preliminary results are presented, indicating progress in the simulation that extends the range of momentum transfers considered, which is necessary for the detailed study of structure functions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is not explicitly stated in the abstract, but it can be inferred that the authors have made advancements in the lattice QCD calculations for the hadronic tensor, which will contribute to a better understanding of the structure functions and related particle interactions.

Abstract: The hadronic tensor is the central non-perturbative object in the calculation of the cross section of lepton-hadron interactions like neutrino-nucleon scattering. It is usually parameterized in terms of structure functions, which encode all necessary information for all kinematic regions. Moreover, the structure functions can be factorized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and contains information on hadron resonances. On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem. In our current work, we extend previous calculations on the nucleon by considering a much larger range of momentum transfers, which is inevitable in the context of structure functions. This can be achieved by using stochastic sources, which allows us to calculate the required four-point functions in a broad kinematic region. We employ a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass $m_π= 223~\mathrm{MeV}$ and lattice spacing $a=0.085~\mathrm{fm}$. In these proceedings, we will give an overview of our simulation and present some first preliminary results.

### [3] [Confined and Deconfined Phases of Qubit Regularized Lattice Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22515)
*Shailesh Chandrasekharan*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers have developed qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories in the MDTN basis, which are free from sign problems. They used classical Monte Carlo methods to study finite-temperature phase transitions, finding expected universality classes. The presence of second-order quantum phase transitions suggests a nonperturbative way to define continuum limits of these theories, potentially leading to the emergence of Yang-Mills theory and other continuum gauge theories from lattice constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory that avoids the sign problem and can exhibit both confined and deconfined phases. The researchers aim to provide a nonperturbative definition of the continuum limit for such theories, with the potential to derive Yang-Mills theory and similar continuum gauge theories from lattice models.

Method: The method involves constructing simple qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories in the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis, which are inherently free from sign problems in the pure gauge sector. The team then employs classical Monte Carlo simulations to explore the finite-temperature phase transitions and their associated universality classes in different spacetime dimensions.

Result: The results show that the finite-temperature phase transitions of the constructed models match the expected universality classes of standard SU(N) lattice gauge theories. The research also provides evidence for the existence of second-order quantum phase transitions between confined and deconfined phases, suggesting a new nonperturbative approach to defining the continuum limit of qubit-regularized gauge theories.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by developing qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories in the MDTN basis, it's possible to avoid the sign problem and observe both confined and deconfined phases. This work opens up the possibility of using second-order quantum phase transitions as a means to define the continuum limit of these theories, potentially leading to the emergence of Yang-Mills and related continuum gauge theories from lattice models.

Abstract: We construct simple qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories formulated in the monomer--dimer--tensor-network (MDTN) basis that are free of sign problems in the pure gauge sector. These models naturally realize both confined and deconfined phases. Using classical Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the associated finite-temperature phase transitions and show that they exhibit the expected universality classes of conventional SU(N) lattice gauge theories in various spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist. Such critical points would provide a nonperturbative route to defining continuum limits of qubit-regularized gauge theories, potentially allowing Yang--Mills theory and related continuum gauge theories to emerge from finite-dimensional lattice constructions.

### [4] [Generalization of lattice Dirac operator index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22858)
*Shoto Aoki,Hajime Fujita,Hidenori Fukaya,Mikio Furuta,Shinichiroh Matsuo,Tetsuya Onogi,Satoshi Yamaguchi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive lattice formulation of Dirac operator indices using $K$-theory, which is applicable to manifolds with boundaries and gravitational effects, and it provides both mathematical proof and numerical evidence for the formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more versatile and generalizable method for formulating Dirac operator indices that can be applied to a wider range of geometric and physical scenarios, including manifolds with curved boundaries and in the presence of gravitational backgrounds, as opposed to the limited applicability of the overlap Dirac operator index.

Method: The authors employ $K$-theory to classify the Wilson Dirac operator by its spectral flow, allowing for the definition of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index on manifolds with boundary, and they extend the mod-2 index to both even and odd dimensions. The approach is supported by mathematical proofs and numerical simulations.

Result: The new formulation of the Dirac operator indices is shown to be effective and applicable to a broader set of cases, including non-flat and odd-dimensional spaces, and it successfully incorporates the effects of a curved boundary and gravitational background.

Conclusion: The proposed lattice formulation of the Dirac operator indices using $K$-theory is more widely applicable than the Ginsparg-Wilson relation-based overlap Dirac operator, as it can handle manifolds with boundaries, curvature, and gravitational effects, and it also extends to the mod-2 index in all dimensions.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive lattice formulation of various types of the Dirac operator indices, employing $K$-theory to classify the Wilson Dirac operator via its spectral flow. In contrast to the index of the overlap Dirac operator defined through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, which is restricted to flat tori in even dimensions, our formulation offers several key advantages: 1) It can be applied straightforwardly to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for manifolds with boundary. 2) The boundary can be curved, allowing for the inclusion of gravitational background effects. 3) The mod-2 index in both even and odd dimensions can be defined as a natural extension of the same formulation. In this talk, we present the mathematical proof and provide numerical evidence supporting the formulation.

### [6] [Confinement transition to gravitational waves in the one-flavor $SU(4)$ Hyper Stealth Dark Matter theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23002)
*V. Ayyar,R. C. Brower,G. T. Fleming,J. Ingoldby,X. Y. Jin,N. Matsumoto,A. S. Meyer,E. T. Neil,J. C. Osborn,S. Park,C. T. Peterson,D. Schaich,P. Vranas,O. Witzel*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the thermodynamics of an $SU(4)$ gauge theory with a single flavor of quarks, which is part of a dark matter model. It also calculates the gravitational wave spectrum from the early universe, showing that dark sea quarks lower the amplitude of these waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the thermodynamic properties of a specific gauge theory that represents the low-energy sector of a strongly-interacting dark matter model, and to explore the impact of this model on the gravitational wave spectrum produced during the first-order confinement transition in the early universe.

Method: The authors use lattice simulations with dynamical fermions to analyze the thermodynamics of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory. They then calculate the gravitational wave spectrum taking into account the effect of dark sea quarks on the interface tension within the effective potential of the Polyakov loop.

Result: The results show that the presence of dark sea quarks decreases the interface tension, which in turn lowers the amplitude of the gravitational waves generated by the first-order confinement transition.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the inclusion of dark sea quarks in the model has a significant effect on the predicted gravitational wave signal, providing new insights into the dynamics of the early universe and the nature of dark matter.

Abstract: The thermodynamics of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory with a single flavor of fundamental quarks is analyzed on the lattice with dynamical fermion simulations, which is the low-energy sector of a realistic, strongly-interacting dark matter model -- the Hyper Stealth Dark Matter. The gravitational wave spectrum from the first-order confinement transition in the early universe is further calculated, where the effect of the dark sea quarks, which decrease the interface tension in the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, is shown numerically to lower the gravitational wave amplitude.

*Ulf-G. Meißner,Akaki Rusetsky,Ajay S. Sakthivasan,Gerrit Schierholz,Jia-Jun Wu*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for calculating resonance form factors, particularly for the $\rho$-meson, using a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem. It provides an initial estimate of the $\rho$-meson's form factors within effective field theory and outlines a procedure for lattice calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the highly challenging task of calculating resonance form factors in effective field theory and on the lattice. The authors aim to provide a novel approach that can be applied to the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$-meson, improving upon existing methods.

Method: The method involves the use of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem. The authors apply this method to calculate the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$-meson, and they match the results with Chiral Perturbation Theory to provide an estimate of the form factors. They also outline a procedure for implementing their method in lattice calculations.

Result: The result is a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $\rho$-meson within the framework of effective field theory. The study finds that contact contributions to these form factors are substantial. A procedure for future lattice calculations is proposed, which could lead to an ab initio solution to the problem of calculating resonance form factors.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the new method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem has the potential to improve the calculation of resonance form factors, as demonstrated by its application to the $\rho$-meson. The outlined procedure for lattice calculations suggests a path forward for more accurate and comprehensive studies of such form factors.

Abstract: The calculation of resonance form factors in effective field theory as well as on the lattice is a highly challenging task. In a recent paper, we proposed a novel method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to address the problem, and applied it to a toy model. In the present work we use this method for the electromagnetic form factors of the $ρ$-meson. By matching the results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, we provide a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $ρ$-meson within the effective field theory. Contact contributions to these form factors turn out to be substantial. A procedure for lattice calculations is outlined, paving the way for an ab initio approach to the problem.

### [8] [Non-perturbative renormalization of the energy momentum tensor in the 2d O(3) nonlinear sigma model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23078)
*Mika Lauk,Agostino Patella*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges in renormalizing the energy-momentum tensor in the 2D O(3) nonlinear sigma model, presenting a precise determination of the relative mixing constant $z_T$ but failing to determine the overall normalization $Z_T$ due to significant discretization artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the central challenge of renormalizing the energy-momentum tensor within the 2D O(3) nonlinear sigma model, which is complicated by non-trivial operator mixing and large discretization artifacts that affect the accuracy of renormalization constants.

Method: The authors use a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and define the renormalized coupling through the gradient flow to calculate the renormalization constants, particularly focusing on the non-singlet sector of the model.

Result: The study provides a precise value for the relative mixing constant $z_T$, but the overall normalization $Z_T$ could not be accurately determined because of the large discretization artifacts.

Conclusion: Despite the difficulties, the work contributes to the understanding of the renormalization process in the 2D O(3) nonlinear sigma model and suggests potential strategies to overcome the current limitations, such as addressing the origins of the large discretization artifacts.

Abstract: The two-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model is a well known toy model for studying non-perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory. A central challenge is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, which is complicated by the nonlinear realization of the $O(3)$ symmetry leading to non-trivial operator mixing patterns, and by large discretization artifacts affecting the determination of renormalization constants. We present results for the renormalization constants in the non-singlet sector, employing a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and defining the renormalized coupling through the gradient flow. While we obtain a precise determination of the relative mixing constant $z_T$, the overall normalization $Z_T$ remains inaccessible due to large discretization artifacts. We discuss the origins of these difficulties and outline possible paths forward.

### [9] [Spatially inhomogeneous confinement-deconfinement phase transition in rotating QGP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23094)
*V. V. Braguta,M. N. Chernodub,Ya. A. Gershtein,A. A. Roenko*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper reports the discovery of a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma, with regions of confining and deconfining states coexisting in thermal equilibrium. The boundary between these phases is influenced by local critical temperature, which is calculated for various angular velocities and radii. The results suggest that confinement occurs at the periphery while deconfinement is near the rotation axis, and this is supported by lattice simulations of rotating QCD with dynamical quarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the behavior of a gluon plasma under rotation, particularly to identify new phases that may emerge and to understand the transition between confining and deconfining states within the plasma.

Method: The researchers used first-principles numerical simulations, including full (imaginary) rotating system calculations, local thermalization approximation, and analytic continuation to real angular frequencies. They also performed the first lattice simulation of rotating QCD with two flavors of dynamical quarks (N_f=2).

Result: A new spatially inhomogeneous phase was found where confining and deconfining states coexist, with the confinement phase localized at the periphery and the deconfinement phase closer to the rotation axis. The anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background explains the observed spatial structure, which deviates from the Tolman-Ehrenfest law expectations. Lattice QCD simulations support these findings even when dynamical quarks are present.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the spatial structure of the inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma is more complex than previously thought, with clear localization of confinement and deconfinement phases, and that this structure can be explained by the anisotropy of the gluon action. The findings are consistent across different methods, including the lattice QCD simulation with dynamical quarks.

Abstract: Using first-principles numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.

### [10] [Universal and non-universal finite-volume effects in the vicinity of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23118)
*Sabarnya Mitra,Jishnu Goswami,Frithjof Karsch*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the finite-size scaling analysis of the chiral phase transition order parameter in QCD with massless quarks, using lattice QCD data. The results show a good agreement with expected $O(2)$ scaling and analyze the impact of finite-size effects on the chiral order parameter and phase transition temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and to determine the chiral phase transition temperature more precisely from Lattice QCD simulations by examining finite-size effects and deviations from asymptotic scaling.

Method: The method involves the use of lattice QCD calculations with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses and different spatial volumes, performing an analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition, and investigating the influence of finite-size effects at a fixed lattice cutoff.

Result: The results indicate that the infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree well with the $O(2)$ scaling behavior, even for physical light-to-strange quark mass ratios, and the study quantifies the deviations from this scaling due to finite-size effects.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the analysis provides a better understanding of the finite-size effects and their influence on the determination of the chiral order parameter and phase transition temperature, which is essential for improving the accuracy of these estimates from Lattice QCD simulations.

Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_σ$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_τ=8$, satisfying $3\,N_τ\leq N_σ\leq 10\,N_τ$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.

### [11] [Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23158)
*Sandip Maiti,Debasish Banerjee,Shailesh Chandrasekharan,Marina K. Marinkovic*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores a 3D lattice model with two flavors of massless staggered fermions and two four-fermion interactions, using Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram. It identifies three distinct phases and characterizes the transitions between them, revealing a multicritical point at vanishing coupling that unifies conventional and unconventional fermion mass generation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phase structure and the nature of the transitions in a system of massless fermions coupled through four-fermion interactions, which can provide insights into the mechanisms of fermion mass generation.

Method: The method involves large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagram of the system in the parameter space defined by the two four-fermion interaction strengths, $U_I$ and $U_B$.

Result: The results include the identification of three distinct phases (massless, symmetry-broken, and symmetric massive) and the characterization of the transitions between these phases, including the discovery of a multicritical point where the direct transition occurs when one of the couplings is zero.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the presence of a nonzero $U_B$ separates the direct transition into two separate transitions, with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase, and that the special point at vanishing coupling acts as a multicritical point, providing a unified view on the mechanisms of fermion mass generation.

Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.

### [12] [Scaling and Luescher Term in a non-Abelian (2+1)d SU$(2)$ Quantum Link Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23213)
*Paul Ludwig,Timo Jakobs,Carsten Urbach*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines a non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions, using tensor network methods to determine the static quark potential and finding evidence of confinement. The Luescher term is observed, but with a dimensionless constant γ that deviates from the expected value. The string width scales logarithmically, indicating a rough string without a roughening transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to study the properties of a non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice, particularly to understand the behavior of the static quark potential and the nature of the confining strings.

Method: The method involves the use of tensor network methods to simulate and analyze the quantum link model on a hexagonal lattice, allowing for the determination of the static quark potential and the investigation of the Luescher term and string properties across a range of coupling values.

Result: The results show that the theory exhibits confinement, and while a Luescher term is present, its associated dimensionless constant γ significantly deviates from the expected universal value. Additionally, the scaling of the string width suggests a rough string without a sign of a roughening transition.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model on a hexagonal lattice is confining, with an unexpected deviation in the Luescher term's coefficient and no indication of a roughening transition in the string behavior.

Abstract: We investigate a non-Abelian SU$(2)$ quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice using tensor network methods. We determine the static quark potential for a wide range of bare coupling values and find that the theory is confining. We also probe the existence of a Luescher term and find a clear signal, however, the value of the dimensionless constant $γ$ strongly deviates from the expected universal value $-π/24$ for almost all values of the coupling $g^2$ we investigated. The width of the strings scales logarithmically with the string length again for all $g^2$-values, providing evidence for a rough string, with no indication for a roughening transition.
