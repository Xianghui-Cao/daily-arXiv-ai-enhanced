Motivation: The motivation is to make further progress in understanding the nature of the chiral phase transition of QCD by exploring theory parameters in areas not affected by the sign problem, which has been a significant barrier in this field.

Method: The method involves a systematic variation of theory parameters, building upon an earlier work at zero chemical potential. The paper details the numerical steps required for data production and analysis, as well as introduces the software tools that will facilitate these studies.

Result: While the abstract does not provide specific results, it sets the stage for a structured approach to studying the chiral phase transition, suggesting that the outcome will be a deeper understanding of this phenomenon through the use of advanced computational methods and software.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that with the outlined programme and the support of released software tools, future research can extend our knowledge of the chiral phase transition of QCD into parameter spaces previously unexplored due to the sign problem.

Abstract: The nature of the chiral phase transition of QCD continues to represent a fundamental open problem in the study of strongly interacting matter. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved by exploiting systematic variations of theory parameters in regimes free of the sign problem. In this work, the idea of a follow-up investigation that extends a previous study at zero chemical potential is presented. A concrete programme for such an extension is discussed, outlining the required numerical steps, from data production to final analysis, and pointing to all the software tools that have been released to support these studies.

### [2] [Comparison of the mixed-fermion-action Effects using different fermion and gauge actions with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19265)
*Zun-Xian Zhang,Mengchu Cai,Bolun Hu,Xiangyu Jiang,Yi-Bo Yang,Dian-Jun Zhao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study calculates the leading-order low-energy constant Δ_mix in mixed-action chiral perturbation theory using specific gauge ensembles and fermions, finding that the fermion action has the major impact, with significant contributions from the gauge action and charm quark loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of different actions and quark flavors on the leading-order low-energy constant Δ_mix in mixed-action chiral perturbation theory, which is important for refining theoretical predictions in particle physics.

Method: The researchers used 2+1+1-flavor gauge ensembles with HISQ fermions and a tadpole-improved Symanzik gauge action across four lattice spacings. They compared their results with those obtained from different actions and a 2+1-flavor case to assess the contributions of various factors.

Result: The study found that the fermion action has the most substantial effect on Δ_mix, but the gauge action and the presence of charm quark loops also play a significant role in determining its value.

Conclusion: Understanding the influence of fermion, gauge actions, and charm quark loops on Δ_mix is crucial for improving the accuracy of theoretical models in particle physics, particularly within the context of mixed-action chiral perturbation theory.

Abstract: The leading-order low-energy constant $Δ_{\rm mix}$ in mixed-action chiral perturbation theory is calculated using $2+1+1$-flavor gauge ensembles with HISQ fermions and a tadpole-improved Symanzik gauge action at four lattice spacings $a \in [0.048, 0.111]$ fm. By comparing our results to those from different actions and a $2+1$-flavor case, we find that the fermion action has the major impact, but the gauge action and charm quark loops also contribute significantly.

### [3] [$f_K/f_π$ in iso-symmetric QCD and the CKM matrix unitarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19294)
*Alessandro Conigli,Julien Frison,Alejandro Sáez*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents lattice QCD results for $f_K/f_π$ and a determination of $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}|$, including isospin-breaking and QED effects, using a combination of Wilson unitary action and mixed-action setup to improve the precision of the continuum-limit extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide more accurate lattice QCD calculations for $f_K/f_π$ and the CKM matrix elements, which are important for testing the Standard Model and investigating possible new physics. The inclusion of isospin-breaking and QED effects aims at a more realistic representation of these quantities.

Method: The method involves using a combination of a Wilson unitary action and a mixed-action setup in lattice QCD simulations with $N_f=2+1$ flavors. This approach allows for better control over the continuum-limit extrapolation, leading to more precise results.

Result: The result is an improved determination of $f_K/f_π$ and the ratio $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}|$, as well as a study on the unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix, taking into account strong isospin-breaking and QED effects.

Conclusion: The conclusion would be that the combined use of the Wilson unitary action and the mixed-action setup provides a powerful tool for lattice QCD studies, resulting in more precise determinations of key quantities like $f_K/f_π$ and CKM matrix elements, which are essential for high-precision tests of the Standard Model.

Abstract: We present lattice results for $f_K/f_π$ in the iso-symmetric limit of pure QCD (isoQCD) with $N_f=2+1$ flavours, along with a determination of $|V_{us}|/|V_{ud}|$ and a study on the unitarity of the first row of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix after introducing strong isospin-breaking and QED effects. The results obtained are based on a combination of a Wilson unitary action and the mixed-action setup introduced in arXiv:2309.14154, arXiv:2510.20450. The combination of the two regularisations enables a more precise control over the continuum-limit extrapolation.

### [4] [Variational Autoregressive Networks Applied to $φ^4$ Field Theory Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19575)
*Moxian Qian,Shiyang Chen*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the combination of reinforcement learning with variational autoregressive networks (VANs) for training and sampling in Ising and φ^4 models, employing KL divergence to measure complexity. It shows that fine-tuning pretrained models can reduce training time and introducing MH updates on VAN proposals decreases residual bias while keeping high sampling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of sampling in complex physical systems such as the discrete Ising model and the continuous φ^4 scalar field theory by integrating reinforcement learning with VANs and using techniques like transfer learning and Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates.

Method: The method involves combining reinforcement learning with variational autoregressive networks (VANs) for data-free training and sampling. The authors also use KL divergence to quantify the complexity of the target distribution and apply transfer learning to pre-trained models. They introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates to correct VAN proposals, which helps to reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling.

Result: The results show that configurations with a smaller KL divergence require fewer training steps, and fine-tuning models at a specific κ value reduces training time. The MH corrections decrease the residual bias of VAN sampling while maintaining high sampling efficiency. The outcomes for both the Ising model and the φ^4 theory are consistent with standard Monte Carlo benchmarks, without exhibiting critical slowing down in the parameter ranges studied.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the integration of reinforcement learning with VANs, along with the application of transfer learning and MH updates, effectively improves the training and sampling processes for the Ising and φ^4 models, achieving high accuracy and efficiency without significant critical slowing down.

Abstract: We combine reinforcement learning with variational autoregressive networks (VANs) to perform data-free training and sampling for the discrete Ising model and the continuous $φ^4$ scalar field theory. We quantify the complexity of the target distribution via the KL divergence between the magnetization distribution and a reference Gaussian distribution, and observe that configurations with smaller KL divergence typically require fewer training steps. Motivated by this observation, we investigate transfer learning and show that fine-tuning models pretrained at a single value of $κ$ can reduce training time compared with training from a Gaussian field. In addition, inspired by single-site and cluster Monte Carlo updates, we introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates on top of VAN proposals. These MH corrections systematically reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling in the parameter range we study, while maintaining high sampling efficiency in terms of the effective sample size (ESS). For both the Ising model and the $φ^4$ theory, our results agree with standard Monte Carlo benchmarks within errors, and no clear critical slowing down is observed in the explored parameter ranges.

*Latévi M. Lawson,Prince K. Osei*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a higher lattice gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions, with an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases, and shows that the ground states are topological observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a theoretical framework for understanding topological phases in 3+1 dimensions using a higher lattice gauge theory based on 2-groups.

Method: The method involves constructing a lattice model using path 2-groupoids and representations of 2-groups, which leads to an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for the system.

Result: The result is the construction of an exactly solvable Hamiltonian, and it is shown that the ground states of this model are topological observables.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the constructed higher lattice gauge theory provides a new approach to studying topological phases in 3+1 dimensions, with the ground states being identified as topological observables.

Abstract: We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables.

### [6] [Quark-mass effects in gradient-flow observables through next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19613)
*Robert V. Harlander,Robert H. Mason*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the numerical calculations of vacuum expectation values for the flowed action density, quark condensate, and quark kinetic operator in N_f-flavor QCD with a focus on heavy quark effects, providing data for fundamental QCD parameter extraction from lattice calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide essential input for the determination of fundamental QCD parameters through lattice calculations by calculating the vacuum expectation values of certain operators, considering the effects of heavy quarks such as charm and bottom, while keeping the results generally applicable to any quark mass.

Method: The method involves using the gradient-flow formalism within N_f-flavor QCD, where one quark is kept massive (to represent heavy quarks like charm or bottom) and all other quarks are treated as massless. The vacuum expectation values of the relevant operators are computed numerically up to next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD perturbation theory.

Result: The results include the calculated vacuum expectation values for the flowed action density, the quark condensate, and the quark kinetic operator, which take into account the effects of having a massive quark and can be used for the extraction of QCD parameters from lattice simulations. The findings are presented in a form that is not tied to specific quark masses, making them more broadly applicable.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the provided numerical results offer valuable input for the extraction of fundamental QCD parameters from lattice calculations, with particular emphasis on the impact of heavy quark masses, and that these results are presented in a general form suitable for use across different quark mass scenarios.

Abstract: We provide results for the vacuum expectation values of the flowed action density, the quark condensate, and the quark kinetic operator in the gradient-flow formalism. We work in $N_\text{F}$-flavor QCD, keeping the heaviest quark massive and all others massless. The vacuum expectation values of these operators are calculated numerically through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD, providing important input for the extraction of fundamental QCD parameters from lattice calculations. While the focus is on charm- and bottom-quark mass effects, we provide the results in a form that is independent of the specific quark mass.
