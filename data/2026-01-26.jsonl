We extend Wegner duality to arbitrary topology and dimension, obtaining a new class of Ising models, in which topology is encoded in non-local domain-wall patterns. Without the overhead of gauge constraints, simulating this model on an L*L torus requires only L*L qubits with two-body couplings, halving the conventional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits, enabling full experimental realization of Z2 lattice gauge theory on near-term devices."}

Lee"], "title": "Coupled-channel approach to isotensor $πππ$ scattering from lattice QCD", "comment": "30 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "The quest to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD includes the study of non-resonant and resonant systems. The isospin $I=2$ system is of particular interest having no three-body resonance but featuring a resonance in a sub-channel, while also being a coupled-channel problem. In this study, we calculate the finite-volume spectrum from lattice QC at two different pion masses, map the amplitude to the infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigate the limit of a narrow $ρ$, and compare with an effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order. Chiral extrapolations between different pion masses are performed."}
