### [1] [Index theorem with Minimally Doubled Fermions in four space-time dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19767)
*Abhijeet Kishore,Subhasish Basak,Dipankar Chakrabarti*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the zero eigenmode spectrum of Minimally Doubled Fermions (MDF) using two formulations and verifies the Atiyah-Singer index theorem with specific background gauge fields. It also examines the spectral flow of eigenvalues for detecting the topology and uses a modified chirality operator to find chiralities and fermionic topological charge.

Motivation: The motivation is to verify the Atiyah-Singer index theorem in the context of Minimally Doubled Fermions and to understand how the spectral flow of eigenvalues can be used to detect the topology of background gauge fields, which is important for lattice QCD simulations.

Method: The method involves determining the zero eigenmode spectrum of MDFs using Karsten-Wilczek and Borici-Creutz formulations on a 4D space-time lattice, employing Smit-Vink and cooled down MILC asqtad ensembles with flavored mass terms, and applying a modified chirality operator to calculate chiralities and fermionic topological charge.

Result: The results show that the Atiyah-Singer index theorem holds for the given background gauge fields, and the spectral flow of eigenvalues successfully detects the topology. The use of the modified chirality operator provides the correct chiralities and fermionic topological charge, consistent with theoretical expectations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the zero eigenmode spectrum of MDFs, when analyzed with the appropriate methods, confirms the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and demonstrates the ability to detect the topology of the background gauge field, supporting the potential use of MDFs in lattice QCD studies.

Abstract: We determine the zero eigenmode spectrum of Minimally Doubled Fermions (MDF), namely in Karsten-Wilczek (KW) and Borici-Creutz (BC) formulations on the 4-dimensional space-time lattice. We employ background gauge fields with integer valued topological charges. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem is verified in the presence of two different background gauge fields, namely Smit-Vink [1] and cooled down MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ dynamical flavors of quarks [2]. Using flavored mass terms [3,4], we find that the spectral flow of the eigenvalues detects the topology of the background gauge field. With the use of the modified chirality operator, we obtain chiralities of the zero eigenmodes and the fermionic topological charge.

### [2] [The Lambda 1405 at the $SU(3)$ point in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19928)
*Javier Suarez Sucunza,Thomas Luu,Carsten Urbach*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the pole structure of Λ(1405) using lattice QCD at the SU(3)-symmetric flavor point, with a focus on baryon-meson states and their energy levels for chiral perturbation theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the debate around the pole structure of Λ(1405) by examining the prediction of a two-pole structure from chiral perturbation theory through lattice QCD simulations.

Method: The method involves constructing interpolation operators in the irreducible representations of SU(3), which are attractive in the channel with the quantum numbers of the singlet and two octets, and then computing correlation functions using the distillation technique on SU(3)-symmetric ensembles with M_π approximately 714 MeV.

Result: The result includes the extraction of energy levels that can serve as input for chiral perturbation theory to determine the poles associated with each representation, providing insights into the pole structure of Λ(1405).

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the extracted energy levels support the application of chiral perturbation theory to understand the pole structure of Λ(1405) and potentially confirm the two-pole structure hypothesis.

Abstract: The pole structure of the $Λ(1405)$ has been a topic of debate for a long time. Chiral perturbation theory predicts that its experimental spectrum may be explained by a two pole structure originating in the $SU(3)$ chiral dynamics of the baryon-meson interaction. The $SU(3)$-symmetric flavor point is readily accessible in lattice QCD, in this work we study the baryon-meson states directly at this point. We construct interpolation operators that belong to the irreducible representations of $SU(3)$ that are attractive in the channel with the quantum numbers of the (singlet and two octets). The extracted energy levels can be used as input for chiral perturbation theory to find the poles associated with each representation. The relevant correlation functions are computed on $SU(3)$-symmetric ensembles with $M_π\approx 714$ MeV using the distillation technique.
