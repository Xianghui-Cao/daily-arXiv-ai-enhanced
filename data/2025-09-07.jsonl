We use a $24^3\\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an\ninverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\\infty$-based formalism.\nOur implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed\ndiagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision\non the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a\ndestructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the\ndecay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The\nprecision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical\ncontribution of the $\\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are\ntested and compared."}
