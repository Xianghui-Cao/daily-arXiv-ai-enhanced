We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures."}
