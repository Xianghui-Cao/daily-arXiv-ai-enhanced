TL;DR: A precise lattice calculation of the $D_s \to \phi \ell \nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay is presented, with improved form factor ratios and branching fractions. The results support future experimental tests of lepton flavor universality and provide an extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the precision of form factors and branching fractions for the $D_s \to \phi \ell \nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay, which is important for testing the lepton flavor universality in high-precision experiments.

Method: The researchers used a (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion configurations on seven gauge ensembles with varying lattice spacings and pion masses. They took both the continuum limit and performed a physical pion mass extrapolation to obtain the form factors, branching fractions, and the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$.

Result: The form factor ratios were determined to be $r_V=1.614(19)$ and $r_2=0.741(31)$, with up to an order of magnitude improvement in precision over previous studies. The branching fractions are reported as $\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi e\nu_e)=2.493(66)_{\text{stat}}(31)_{|V_{cs}|}\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi\mu\nu_\mu)=2.351(60)_{\text{stat}}(29)_{|V_{cs}|}\times 10^{-2}$. The ratio of branching fractions between the muon and electron channels is $\mathcal{R}_{\mu/e}=0.9432(13)$. The extracted CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is $0.952(12)_{\text{stat}}(23)_{\text{PDG}}$ and $0.945(12)_{\text{stat}}(24)_{\text{PDG}}$ for the $\mu$ and $e$ channels, respectively.

Conclusion: The study provides essential theoretical input for future high-precision experimental tests of the lepton flavor universality, with more accurate form factor ratios and branching fractions than previous lattice calculations, and an updated value of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$.

Abstract: We present a systematic lattice calculation of the $D_s \to \phi \ell
\nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay using (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion
configurations generated by the CLQCD collaboration. Seven gauge ensembles with
different lattice spacings, from $0.052~\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\text{fm}$, and
different pion masses, from about $210~\text{MeV}$ to $320~\text{MeV}$ are
utilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass
extrapolation. The ratios of form factors are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$
and $r_2=0.741(31)$, with the precision improved by up to an order of magnitude
compared to previous lattice studies. The branching fractions are given as
$\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi e\nu_e)=2.493(66)_{\text{stat}}(31)_{|V_{cs}|}\times
10^{-2}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(D_s\to\phi\mu\nu_\mu)=2.351(60)_{\text{stat}}(29)_{|V_{cs}|}\times
10^{-2}$. The corresponding ratio of the branching fractions between the lepton
$\mu$ and $e$ is given by $\mathcal{R}_{\mu/e}=0.9432(13)$, which provides
essential theoretical support for future high-precision experimental tests of
the lepton flavor universality. The CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also
extracted to be $0.952(12)_{\text{stat}}(23)_{\text{PDG}}$ and
$0.945(12)_{\text{stat}}(24)_{\text{PDG}}$ for the $\mu$ and $e$ channels,
respectively.
