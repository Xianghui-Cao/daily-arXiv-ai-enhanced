Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive study of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, focusing on their renormalization within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). It includes classification, Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. The authors also provide conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme for selected variants with smaller mixing effects.

Motivation: The motivation is to thoroughly analyze a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, particularly those that do not mix with lower-dimensional operators due to their flavor-symmetry group transformation properties, and to understand their renormalization behavior within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS).

Method: The method involves a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, investigating their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. The authors explore different versions of GIRS, including a democratic version, and calculate conversion matrices for certain variants to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.

Result: The results include a systematic classification of four-quark operators, an understanding of their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns under various GIRS schemes, and the provision of conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme for specific variants with reduced mixing effects.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a deeper insight into the renormalization of four-quark operators, offering a foundation for further studies in this area and providing tools for the calculation of physical observables involving such operators.

Abstract: In this paper we study a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark
operators, with a particular emphasis on their renormalization within a
Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). We focus on operators that do
not mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation
properties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\Delta F =
2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same
irreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial
subset of $\Delta F = 1$ and $\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis
provides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their
Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants
of GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing
operators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing
effects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.
