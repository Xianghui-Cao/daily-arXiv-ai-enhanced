### [1] [Comment on the claim of physical irrelevance of the topological term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10127)
*Tanmoy Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper corrects a misunderstanding about the claim of no CP-violating effects from a topological term in QCD, reaffirming the standard results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and rectify the misconception regarding the absence of CP-violating effects attributed to a topological term within QCD, ensuring the accuracy of the accepted scientific understanding.

Method: The method involves a theoretical analysis and critique of the arguments that led to the claim of no CP-violation, likely through a review of existing literature and theoretical reasoning.

Result: The result is the confirmation that the standard results concerning CP-violation in QCD are indeed correct, and the previous claim of no such effects due to a topological term is based on a misunderstanding.

Conclusion: The conclusion reinforces the validity of the established knowledge on CP-violation in QCD and highlights the importance of accurate interpretation of theoretical physics concepts.

Abstract: We argue that the claim of the absence of charge-conjugation-parity (CP) violating effects due to a topological term in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is based upon a misunderstanding, and the standard results in the field are correct.

### [2] [QCD on the 16-cell honeycomb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10604)
*Sandor D. Katz,Daniel Nogradi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a QCD formulation on a 16-cell honeycomb lattice, demonstrating improved rotational symmetry and scaling properties compared to the traditional cubic lattice, with benefits for chiral and topological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve upon the limitations of the traditional cubic lattice in QCD by using a 16-cell honeycomb lattice, which offers better rotational symmetry and reduced cut-off effects, allowing for more accurate simulations at larger lattice spacings.

Method: The method involves formulating QCD on a four-dimensional 16-cell honeycomb lattice and comparing its performance against the conventional cubic lattice through quenched QCD simulations, evaluating both gluonic and fermionic observables as well as chiral and topological characteristics.

Result: The results show that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice provides superior scaling properties and allows for controlled continuum extrapolations even at much larger lattice spacings. Additionally, there are notable improvements in the chiral and topological sectors of the theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice can be a viable alternative to the cubic lattice for QCD simulations, offering enhanced accuracy and efficiency due to its higher degree of rotational symmetry and smaller cut-off effects.

Abstract: We formulate QCD discretized on the four dimensional 16-cell honeycomb. The advantage is a higher degree of rotational symmetry as compared to a traditional cubic lattice leading to much smaller cut-off effects. We demonstrate in quenched QCD, through both gluonic and fermionic observables, that the scaling properties are indeed superior to the cubic lattice and much larger lattice spacings are sufficient for controlled continuum extrapolations. Chiral and topological properties also show remarkable improvement.

### [3] [Investigating a two-level algorithm for fermionic observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10644)
*Lorenzo Barca,Jacob Finkenrath,Stefan Schaefer*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores a method that combines a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation to compute disconnected fermionic correlation functions, achieving an exponential reduction in statistical errors at a similar computational cost as standard methods. The method is validated on pure gauge ensembles and is being prepared for use in dynamical QCD studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the computation of disconnected fermionic correlation functions, which are important for studies involving glueballs and isosinglet mesons in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

Method: A two-level sampling algorithm is combined with distillation techniques, using a factorization of the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that are dependent on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions, allowing for independent submeasurements.

Result: The method demonstrates the expected variance scaling with respect to the number of samples, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieves a significant reduction in statistical errors while maintaining a comparable computational cost to traditional sampling methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the new method is effective and could be a valuable tool for future dynamical QCD studies, particularly in the context of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions.

Abstract: We investigate the combination of a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques to compute disconnected fermionic correlation functions. The method relies on a factorization of the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that depend only on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions, enabling independent submeasurements of each term through a two-level sampling strategy. The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method is tested on pure gauge ensembles, providing a controlled benchmark for its forthcoming application to dynamical QCD studies of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions.
