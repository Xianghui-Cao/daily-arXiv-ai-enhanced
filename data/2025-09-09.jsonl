We completely\ncharacterize the CSE in QCD using $2+1$ simulations of staggered quarks tuned\nat the physical point. We find that the CSE conductivity is severely suppressed\nat low temperatures, and experiences a very sharp increase around the QCD\ncrossover transition, reaching the value of massless non-interacting fermions\nat high temperatures. This is the first non-perturbative calculation of an\nanomalous transport conductivity in physical QCD. In the case of the CME, we\nshow that this effect is not present in thermal equilibrium, in accordance with\nBloch's theorem, both for free fermions and in QCD. We emphasize the crucial\nrole of using a conserved vector current in the study of anomalous transport\nphenomena on the lattice, and how the use of non-conserved currents is behind\nnon-vanishing results for the CME in equilibrium that can be found in the\nliterature. Finally, we study the interplay between the CME and inhomogeneous\nmagnetic fields, which leads us to find a novel localized CME signal in\nequilibrium. This does not contradict Bloch's theorem, since the total signal\naverages to zero when summed over the full volume. This effect is present in\nphysical QCD, showing that a local equilibrium CME signal is possible in the\npresence of gluonic interactions."}
