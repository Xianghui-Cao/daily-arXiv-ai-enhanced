  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding the probability distribution effectively sampled by the complex Langevin process in theories with a sign problem, which is not known beforehand and difficult to comprehend. The authors aim to leverage the capabilities of diffusion models, used in generative AI, for learning such distributions or their log derivatives from data, potentially opening up new applications.

Method: The method involves applying and comparing two types of diffusion models - score-based and energy-based - to learn the distributions generated by a complex Langevin process. This approach aims to provide a novel way to tackle the sign problem in theoretical physics through the lens of machine learning, specifically using techniques from generative AI.

Result: The results of the study are expected to shed light on the effectiveness of diffusion models in capturing the intricate probability distributions that arise from a complex Langevin process, offering insights into which type of diffusion model (score-based or energy-based) might be more suitable for this task. The exact outcomes, however, are not detailed in the abstract, indicating that the full paper would contain a thorough analysis and comparison.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely discusses the potential of diffusion models as a tool for understanding and working with complex probability distributions in the context of theories suffering from a sign problem. It may also outline the advantages and limitations of each type of diffusion model explored and suggest future research directions, including practical applications in both theoretical physics and generative AI.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can
sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified
configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled
by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to
understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or
their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to
learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing
score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of automated machine learning algorithms in recognizing phase transitions within quantum geometries as observed through numerical data from lattice quantum gravity simulations, potentially improving upon standard methods that rely on order parameters.

Method: Conducted Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations and applied a variety of 14 machine learning models (7 supervised and 7 unsupervised) to the simulation data to identify and analyze the phase transitions.

Result: Most of the tested machine learning models were highly effective in recognizing the phase transitions, and their performance surpassed that of conventional approaches based on order parameters.

Conclusion: Automated machine learning provides a powerful tool for the analysis of phase transitions in quantum gravity, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods and opening new avenues for research in the field.

Abstract: Using numerical data coming from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional
Causal Dynamical Triangulations, we study how automated machine learning
algorithms can be used to recognize transitions between different phases of
quantum geometries observed in lattice quantum gravity. We tested seven
supervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models and found that most
of them were very successful in that task, even outperforming standard methods
based on order parameters.

### [3] [Flux tubes in QCD at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02177)
*Marshall Baker,Paolo Cea,Volodymyr Chelnokov,Leonardo Cosmai,Alessandro Papa*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study examines the chromo-electric field between a quark-antiquark pair in lattice QCD, showing evidence of a chromo-magnetic current and a longitudinal chromo-electric field. The field's properties change with temperature, suggesting a screened string tension at high temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the chromo-electric field generated by a static quark-antiquark pair as the temperature increases, particularly through and beyond the chiral transition, and to investigate the characteristics of this field in different temperature regimes.

Method: Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations with 2+1 dynamical staggered fermions at physical quark masses are used to analyze the evolution of the chromo-electric field with increasing temperature.

Result: Evidence for a chromo-magnetic current and a nearly uniform longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric field along the flux tube is found. The effective string tension decreases exponentially with temperature, and the flux-tube width follows an inverse-temperature law at high temperatures, indicating a screened string tension above the chiral pseudocritical temperature.

Conclusion: The research concludes that the quark-antiquark system can be described by a screened string tension in the high-temperature region, and the properties of the chromo-electric field evolve in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations as the temperature rises.

Abstract: We present results for the chromo-electric field generated by a static
quark-antiquark pair at finite temperature, in lattice QCD with 2+1 dynamical
staggered fermions at physical quark masses. We investigate the evolution of
the field as the temperature increases through and beyond the chiral
transition. For all the temperatures considered we find clear evidence of a
chromo-magnetic current and of a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric
field that stays almost uniform along the flux tube. In the high-temperature
region the magnitude of the flux-tube field is determined by an effective
string tension that decreases exponentially as the temperature increases, while
the flux-tube width decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. Our
results suggest that beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature the
quark-antiquark system can be characterized by a screened string tension.
