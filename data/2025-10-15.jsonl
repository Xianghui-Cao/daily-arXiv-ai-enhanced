A new approach to this\nproblem based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation has been proposed by Bergamaschi\net al. Here we extend their method by exploring the propagation of the\nstatistical and systematic errors that accompany a lattice QCD calculation\nthrough this interpolation process. A simplified example of a multiparticle\nspectral function is studied with a focus on the possible applications of these\nmethods to the calculation of inclusive heavy-particle decays."}

The DGL theory describes the QCD vacuum as a dual\nsuperconductor and possesses electric flux-tube solutions via the dual Meissner\neffect, which applies to the quark confinement mechanism. We demonstrate a\npowerful numerical method for solving the field equations in the DGL theory\nwith U(1) dual gauge symmetry. An essential aspect of our method is to\nformulate the DGL theory on the dual lattice, which enables us to investigate\nany system composed of finite-length flux tubes in a systematic manner. Taking\nfull advantage of the dual lattice formulation, we investigate the\nfinite-length flux-tube solution corresponding to the quark-antiquark system in\ndetail, which exposes the significant terminal effects absent in the infinitely\nlong flux-tube solution. We also study the flux-tube interaction in the two-\nand multi-flux-tube systems, providing new insights into the nonperturbative\nproperties of QCD."}
