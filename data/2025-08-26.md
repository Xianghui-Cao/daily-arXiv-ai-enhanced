### [1] [Baryon Electric Charge Correlation as QCD Magnetometer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17021)
*Heng-Tong Ding,Jin-Biao Gu,Arpith Kumar,Sheng-Tai Li*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper proposes baryon electric charge correlation and chemical potential ratio as probes to detect strong magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions, showing significant increases under certain conditions. It also provides a bridge between theoretical predictions and experimental observables through the hadron resonance gas model, offering new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and guidance for experiments.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop sensitive probes for detecting strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, which is important for observing phenomena like the chiral magnetic effect but has been very challenging to achieve so far.

Method: The authors use (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass to study the baryon electric charge correlation and the chemical potential ratio. They apply kinematic cuts to match detector acceptances of STAR and ALICE experiments using the hadron resonance gas model.

Result: The results show that along the transition line, the baryon electric charge correlation and the chemical potential ratio increase significantly with a strong magnetic field. The chemical potential ratio is also found to be sensitive to the collision system, indicating a substantial increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar collisions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed observables, baryon electric charge correlation and chemical potential ratio, are effective in probing strong magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions, and they provide experimentally relevant guidance, thus offering new insights into thermo-magnetic effects.

Abstract: The detection of strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is
crucial for observing effects such as the chiral magnetic effect but has proven
exceptionally difficult. To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge
correlation $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm
Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor
lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line,
$\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb
collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$,
respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables,
we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the
STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows
us to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the
collision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar
collisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and
provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields
in heavy-ion collisions.

### [2] [Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Unpolarized Quarks at Nonzero Skewness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17998)
*Min-Huan Chu,Manuel Cola√ßo,Shohini Bhattacharya,Krzysztof Cichy,Martha Constantinou,Andreas Metz,Fernanda Steffens*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper extends the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to include longitudinal momentum transfer, which is tested with lattice data and leads to the extraction of GPDs H and E. The challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs are also discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more complete theoretical framework for GPDs that includes the effects of longitudinal momentum transfer, allowing for a broader range of kinematic conditions to be explored, and to make the full mapping of GPDs from lattice QCD calculations more feasible.

Method: The method involves extending the existing formalism based on Lorentz-invariant amplitudes to account for nonzero skewness. Lattice data with both transverse and longitudinal, or only longitudinal, momentum transfer are used to test the formalism, and the GPDs H and E are expressed in terms of extracted amplitudes in coordinate space.

Result: The result is a formalism capable of dealing with GPDs at nonzero skewness, which has been tested using lattice data. This allows for the reconstruction of quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone, as well as the identification of key challenges associated with nonzero skewness GPDs.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the extension of the formalism to nonzero skewness successfully provides an efficient way to map GPDs across a broad range of kinematics, including longitudinal momentum transfer, and sets the stage for further lattice QCD studies of GPDs.

Abstract: We extend the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) to the case of nonzero skewness, i.e., including
longitudinal momentum transfer. The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant
amplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for
unpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient
access to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the
lattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data
with both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer,
the latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent
amplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs
$H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of
quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify
and discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs.
