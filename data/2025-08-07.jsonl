Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are\neither integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of\ntranslationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited\nenergies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or\nemergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these\ninvestigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are\nlattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also\ngenerically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter.\nUsing a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of\nathermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is\nsubjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes\nin the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an\ninterplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes\nexotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities.\nThis causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical\narguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in\nthe linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify\nsectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The\nunitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different\nfrom the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations."}
