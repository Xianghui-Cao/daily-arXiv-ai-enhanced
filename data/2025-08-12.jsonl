Simulations employ\nthe highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on\nlattices of temporal extent $N_\\tau = 8,\\,12$, covering $145 \\lesssim T\n\\lesssim 165~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \\lesssim 0.8~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing\nstrangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon\nnumber ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and\n$s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure\ncoefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\\rm B}$, and\nenergy-like coefficients $\\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\\epsilon_2$ (energy\ndensity), and $\\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce\ntemperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in\nthe energy-like coefficients, with $\\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly\nvanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the\npressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence,\nfinding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field\nenhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for\nneutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG)\nmodel show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear\ndeviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide\nuseful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in\nstrong magnetic fields at finite baryon density."}

The\ncomplex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\\pi$ on large\nspatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the\nMonte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy\nassociated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices\nwith spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\\tau=2$.\nOur results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the\ndomain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the\ndecay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined\ninterfaces."}
