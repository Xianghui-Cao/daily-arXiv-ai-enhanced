Simulations employ\nthe highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on\nlattices of temporal extent $N_\\tau = 8,\\,12$, covering $145 \\lesssim T\n\\lesssim 165~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \\lesssim 0.8~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing\nstrangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon\nnumber ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and\n$s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure\ncoefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\\rm B}$, and\nenergy-like coefficients $\\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\\epsilon_2$ (energy\ndensity), and $\\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce\ntemperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in\nthe energy-like coefficients, with $\\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly\nvanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the\npressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence,\nfinding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field\nenhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for\nneutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG)\nmodel show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear\ndeviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide\nuseful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in\nstrong magnetic fields at finite baryon density.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents results from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations for the equation of state under strong magnetic fields and nonzero baryon chemical potential, using the HISQ action. It examines the temperature and magnetic field dependence of various thermodynamic coefficients, revealing non-monotonic behavior and qualitative agreement with the hadron resonance gas model at low temperatures and weak fields, while showing deviations near the crossover and at strong fields.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a better understanding of the equation of state in QCD matter under conditions of strong magnetic fields and finite baryon density, which is relevant for astrophysical environments such as neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions.", "method": "The method involves performing (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations with the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action, simulating across a range of temperatures and magnetic fields, and analyzing the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state.", "result": "Results include the determination of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of several thermodynamic quantities, such as the electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios, pressure, baryon number density, and energy-like coefficients. The study finds non-monotonic behavior, temperature-band crossings, and the dominance of the pressure term over the energy contribution at high temperatures and strong fields. Additionally, the paper explores the effect of varying the electric charge to baryon number ratio, finding that charge-neutral matter shows less enhancement of the pressure coefficient despite larger absolute values of the electric charge chemical potential ratio.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the findings provide valuable input for models and effective theories of QCD matter in strong magnetic fields and at finite baryon density, with notable features such as non-monotonic structures and temperature-band crossings, and that the results are consistent with expectations from the hadron resonance gas model at low temperatures and weak fields, but deviate significantly in the crossover region and at strong fields."}}
