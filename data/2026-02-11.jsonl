The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $β_0= 2.0$ on an $8\\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $β$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|Δ| \\leq 0.001$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|Δ| < 0.06$ across $β\\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\\sim 0.003$ for $β\\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories."}

To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\\langle μ\\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\\langle μ\\rangle \\neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\\langle μ\\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.\n  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.\n  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved."}

Working in the approximation where charm-annihilation is forbidden, with two degenerate light-quark flavors and a heavier strange quark, isospin is a good quantum number, and the only other other channel that is kinematically open is $η_cη$. Using lattice QCD we compute, as a function of varying light-quark mass, the $S$-matrix for coupled-channel $η_cη- D\\bar{D}$ scattering and find only weakly interacting meson pairs. In contrast to several other studies, we find no evidence for any bound-state or resonance singularity in the energy region between the deeply-bound $χ_{c0}(1P)$ state and the $D_s\\bar{D}_s$ threshold."}

This observable, referred to as the $\\textit{simplicity}$, is defined as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort. Our results suggest that Abelian current loops are strongly correlated with the degrees of freedoms of the theory that determine confinement. Our investigation opens new perspectives for the definition of an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics able to expose the potentially rich phase structure of the theory."}
