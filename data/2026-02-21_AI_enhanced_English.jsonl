In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a general method, based on meson dominance and the variational method, to identify and control excited states that contribute to systematic uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations of hadron structure. The approach is supported by numerical data and chiral perturbation theory, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidelines, especially for nucleon sector analyses.", "motivation": "The motivation of this paper is to address the issue of excited-state contamination, which is a significant source of systematic uncertainty in the accurate determination of hadron structure observables using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).", "method": "The author proposes a mechanism rooted in the concept of meson dominance and utilizes the variational method as a tool to pinpoint the specific excited states that are emphasized due to the selection of inserted currents and kinematics. This method is validated with numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across various hadronic channels.", "result": "The results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively identify the relevant excited states, providing a way to mitigate their impact on the precision of hadron structure calculations, particularly within the nucleon sector. The findings are consistent with both numerical simulations and theoretical expectations from chiral perturbation theory.", "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper is that the presented mechanism offers a clear understanding of the role of excited states in hadron three-point function analyses and provides practical advice for reducing their influence, thereby improving the accuracy of hadron structure determinations in lattice QCD studies."}}

We investigate the $DD\u03c0$ system in the $I=0$, $C=2$ sector, where the $T_{cc}^+$ appears as a pole in the $J^P = 1^+$ $DD\u03c0$ elastic scattering amplitude. The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DD\u03c0$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $\u03c0$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_\u03c0\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $D\u03c0$ two-body subsystems. We present preliminary results for these subchannels and perform exploratory three-body spectra determinations for simple choices of the three-particle K-matrix $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{df}, 3}$, allowing a first comparison to the lattice spectrum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $\u03bc_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $\u03bc_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \\times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $\u03bba = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_\u03c0= 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \\cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the impact of isospin asymmetry on quarkonium states, particularly the Upsilon mass, in near-zero temperature QCD using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD. The study reveals that at a specific isospin chemical potential, the Upsilon mass increases, and the effect is non-monotonic below this value.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand how isospin asymmetry, represented by an isospin chemical potential, affects the properties of quarkonium states, such as their masses, in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at temperatures close to zero.", "method": "The method involves the use of lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism to calculate bottom quark correlators from gauge field ensembles with varying isospin chemical potentials. These ensembles are generated with two plus one flavors of dynamical staggered quarks, and the ratios of quarkonium correlators at different isospin chemical potentials are analyzed.", "result": "The results indicate that the Upsilon mass becomes heavier at a high isospin chemical potential (\u03bc_I a = 0.106) compared to its mass in the vacuum. Additionally, the effect of isospin asymmetry on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic for lower values of the isospin chemical potential.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the preliminary results is that the isospin asymmetry has a significant and complex impact on the Upsilon mass, with the mass increasing at higher isospin chemical potentials and showing a non-monotonic behavior at lower potentials."}}
