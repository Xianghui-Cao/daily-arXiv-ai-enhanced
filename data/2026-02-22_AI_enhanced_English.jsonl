In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses a new method to identify and control excited states that cause systematic uncertainties in the determination of hadron structure observables using lattice QCD, with supporting numerical evidence and chiral perturbation theory predictions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the issue of excited-state contamination, which is a major source of systematic uncertainty in the precise measurement of hadron structure observables from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).", "method": "A general mechanism, inspired by meson dominance, is proposed and executed through the variational method. This approach aims to pinpoint the specific excited states that are amplified by the selection of inserted currents and kinematics, supported by both numerical data and theoretical predictions from chiral perturbation theory.", "result": "The results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the relevant excited states across various hadronic channels, particularly within the nucleon sector, offering a way to better control these effects in three-point function analyses.", "conclusion": "The conclusion suggests that the presented mechanism provides valuable insights and practical advice for mitigating excited-state contamination, thereby improving the accuracy of hadron structure calculations in lattice QCD."}}

We investigate the $DD\u03c0$ system in the $I=0$, $C=2$ sector, where the $T_{cc}^+$ appears as a pole in the $J^P = 1^+$ $DD\u03c0$ elastic scattering amplitude. The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DD\u03c0$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $\u03c0$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_\u03c0\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $D\u03c0$ two-body subsystems. We present preliminary results for these subchannels and perform exploratory three-body spectra determinations for simple choices of the three-particle K-matrix $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{df}, 3}$, allowing a first comparison to the lattice spectrum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $\u03bc_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $\u03bc_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \\times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $\u03bba = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_\u03c0= 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \\cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the impact of isospin asymmetry on quarkonium states in QCD at near-zero temperature using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, with preliminary results indicating that the Upsilon mass increases at a high isospin chemical potential but shows non-monotonic behavior below this value.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand how isospin asymmetry, represented by an isospin chemical potential, affects the properties of quarkonium states, particularly their masses, in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).", "method": "Lattice Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) formalism is employed to calculate bottom quark correlators from gauge field ensembles, which include the effect of an isospin chemical potential. The researchers then construct S- and P-wave quarkonium state correlators and examine the ratios of these correlators at different isospin chemical potentials.", "result": "Preliminary results indicate that at the highest isospin chemical potential (\u03bc_I a = 0.106), the Upsilon (a quarkonium state) mass is heavier than in the vacuum. For lower isospin chemical potentials, the effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic, suggesting a more complex relationship between isospin asymmetry and quarkonium mass.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the preliminary results is that the isospin asymmetry has a significant and non-trivial impact on the mass of quarkonium states, such as the Upsilon, with the mass increasing at high isospin chemical potential and showing a non-monotonic behavior for lower values."}}
