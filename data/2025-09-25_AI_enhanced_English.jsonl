Traditional compactifications at finite temperature\nwithout rotations typically involve ${\\mathbb T}^4$ as the space-time manifold\nwithin a path integral formulation and also moving frames can be accommodated\nby shifted boundary conditions on the same space. We show that consistent\ndescriptions of a rotating box are possible on space-time manifolds with\ntopology different from ${\\mathbb T}^4$ but still flat and without boundary and\nwe classify all possible geometries. The non-trivial topology may be\nimplemented by rotated boundary conditions allowing for a path integral\nformulation. The purely imaginary angular velocity in temperature units cannot\nbe arbitrary but several discrete values are possible. We also discuss finite\nvolume effects in detail.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores thermal quantum field theory in a rotating, finite spatial periodic volume, revealing that consistent descriptions can be achieved with space-time manifolds of topology different from the traditional ${\\mathbb T}^4$. It also classifies possible geometries and discusses the constraints on purely imaginary angular velocity and finite volume effects.", "motivation": "The motivation is to extend the understanding of thermal quantum field theory by incorporating rotation into the framework, which was previously only applied to non-rotating systems. This extension aims to explore new topologies for space-time manifolds that can accommodate a rotating system, as well as to define the allowed values of angular velocity and analyze the resulting finite volume effects.", "method": "The authors use a path integral formulation with rotated boundary conditions to describe the rotating system. They classify all possible flat and boundary-free geometries that can serve as space-time manifolds for the rotating thermal quantum field theory. The method includes an analysis of the discrete values of the purely imaginary angular velocity that are compatible with the system.", "result": "The results include the classification of space-time manifolds that can support a rotating thermal quantum field theory, the identification of the discrete set of permissible values for the purely imaginary angular velocity, and a detailed discussion of the finite volume effects associated with these configurations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that it is indeed possible to formulate thermal quantum field theory on a rotating, finite periodic volume with topologies other than ${\\mathbb T}^4$, and this leads to a quantization of the angular velocity. The study provides a foundation for further research on the effects of rotation on quantum fields at finite temperature."}}
