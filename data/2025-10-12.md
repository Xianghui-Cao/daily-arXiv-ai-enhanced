### [1] [The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006)
*Claudio Bonanno*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility in SU(N) Yang-Mills theories using lattice Monte Carlo simulations and the PTBC algorithm, which allows for more precise results and a uniform range of lattice spacing. The author also demonstrates the independence of the continuum limit of the susceptibility from the choice of smoothing radius and provides a comparison with previous studies.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the topological susceptibility in SU(N) Yang-Mills theories by overcoming the limitations of topological freezing and exploring a wider range of lattice spacings and N values.

Method: The method involves non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, employing the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N>3$. The study covers a range of $N$ from 3 to 6 and takes the continuum limit at a fixed smoothing radius in physical units.

Result: The result is a precise determination of the topological susceptibility for finer lattice spacings than in previous studies. The author also shows that the continuum limit of the susceptibility is independent of the choice of smoothing radius and provides a detailed comparison with other determinations in the literature.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the use of the PTBC algorithm has allowed for an improved and more uniform exploration of the topological susceptibility across different $N$ values, leading to a better understanding of its behavior in the continuum limit, and a critical assessment of the consistency with earlier work.

Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$
of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte
Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and
adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to
bypass topological freezing for $N>3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to
explore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to
precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous
studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum
limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the
independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude
providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous
determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at
finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.
