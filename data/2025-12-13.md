### [1] [Comment on the claim of physical irrelevance of the topological term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10127)
*Tanmoy Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper clarifies a misunderstanding regarding the absence of CP-violating effects due to a topological term in QCD, affirming that the standard results are indeed correct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address and correct a specific misunderstanding in the field concerning the impact of a topirical term on CP-violation within QCD, thereby reinforcing the validity of established results.

Method: The method involves a critical review and analysis of the existing claim about the absence of CP-violating effects, likelyg on theoretical physics and possibly mathematical proofs to support their argument.

Result: It is concluded that the original claim of no CP-violating effects due to the topological term was based on a misunderstanding, and the paper supports the correctness of the standard results in the field.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by reaffirming the accuracy of the standard results in QCD regarding CP-violation, dismissing the previous claim as a result of a misunderstanding.

Abstract: We argue that the claim of the absence of charge-conjugation-parity (CP) violating effects due to a topological term in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is based upon a misunderstanding, and the standard results in the field are correct.

### [2] [QCD on the 16-cell honeycomb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10604)
*Sandor D. Katz,Daniel Nogradi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores QCD on a 16-cell honeycomb lattice, demonstrating improved rotational symmetry and scaling properties over the traditional cubic lattice, with better chiral and topological properties, allowing for more reliable continuum extrapolations at larger lattice spacings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon the limitations of the traditional cubic lattice in QCD by utilizing a 16-cell honeycomb lattice, which offers higher rotational symmetry and reduced cut-off effects, leading to more accurate simulations and continuum extrapolations.

Method: The authors employ a quenched QCD approach on the 16-cell honeycomb lattice, evaluating both gluonic and fermionic observables to assess the scaling properties and other physical characteristics compared to those on a cubic lattice.

Result: Results show that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice provides superior scaling properties and much smaller cut-off effects than the cubic lattice. Additionally, there are significant improvements in chiral and topological properties, enabling more controlled continuum extrapolations even at larger lattice spacings.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice formulation of QCD leads to enhanced rotational symmetry, better scaling, and improved chiral and topological properties, making it a promising alternative to the conventional cubic lattice for future QCD studies.

Abstract: We formulate QCD discretized on the four dimensional 16-cell honeycomb. The advantage is a higher degree of rotational symmetry as compared to a traditional cubic lattice leading to much smaller cut-off effects. We demonstrate in quenched QCD, through both gluonic and fermionic observables, that the scaling properties are indeed superior to the cubic lattice and much larger lattice spacings are sufficient for controlled continuum extrapolations. Chiral and topological properties also show remarkable improvement.

### [3] [Investigating a two-level algorithm for fermionic observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10644)
*Lorenzo Barca,Jacob Finkenrath,Stefan Schaefer*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques to efficiently compute disconnected fermionic correlation functions, demonstrating reduced statistical errors and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient method for computing disconnected fermionic correlation functions, which are important in QCD studies, particularly for glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions, by reducing statistical errors without significantly increasing computational cost.

Method: The method involves factorizing the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that depend only on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions. This allows for independent submeasurements using a two-level sampling strategy, which shows the expected variance scaling and an exponential reduction of statistical errors.

Result: The results show that the two-level estimators have the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and they achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method was tested successfully on pure gauge ensembles, setting a benchmark for future applications in dynamical QCD studies.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques is effective in reducing the statistical errors of disconnected fermionic correlation functions, making it a promising approach for future QCD studies involving glueballs and isosinglet mesons.

Abstract: We investigate the combination of a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques to compute disconnected fermionic correlation functions. The method relies on a factorization of the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that depend only on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions, enabling independent submeasurements of each term through a two-level sampling strategy. The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method is tested on pure gauge ensembles, providing a controlled benchmark for its forthcoming application to dynamical QCD studies of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions.
