However, conventional approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in imaginary time are limited, as they do not allow real time evolution and suffer from a sign problem in many important cases. Using Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) as a variational ground state ansatz offers an alternative for studying LGTs through a sign-problem-free variational MC. As this method is extended to larger and more complex systems, understanding its numerical behavior becomes essential. While conventional action based MC has been extensively studied, the performance and characteristics of non-action-based MC within the GGFPEPS framework are far less explored. In this work, we investigate these algorithmic aspects, identifying an optimal update size for GGFPEPS-based MC simulations for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ in $2+1$ dimensions. We show that gauge fixing generally slows convergence, and demonstrate that not exploiting the translation-invariance can, in some cases, improve the computational time scaling of error convergence. We expect that these improvements will allow advancing the simulation to larger and more complex systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, we outline how a kernel can be used to solve the problem of wrong convergence in a simple toy model. Since conventional correctness criteria for complex Langevin results are only necessary but not sufficient, the correct convergence of complex Langevin simulations is not always straightforward to assess. Hence, we furthermore discuss a condition for correctness that we have recently derived, which is both necessary and sufficient. Finally, we outline a machine-learning approach for finding suitable kernels in lattice gauge theories and present preliminary results of its application to the heavy-dense limit of QCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the use of kernels in complex Langevin simulations to address convergence issues, introduces a new necessary and sufficient condition for correctness, and presents a machine-learning approach for finding suitable kernels, with preliminary results applied to QCD's heavy-dense limit.", "motivation": "The motivation is to solve the problem of wrong convergence in complex Langevin simulations and to develop a more reliable method for assessing the correct convergence of such simulations, which is not always straightforward with existing criteria. Additionally, the authors aim to find appropriate kernels for lattice gauge theories using a machine learning approach.", "method": "The authors employ a kernel within a simple toy model to demonstrate how it can resolve incorrect convergence. They also derive a new condition for ensuring the correctness of complex Langevin simulation outcomes, which is both necessary and sufficient. Furthermore, they apply a machine learning technique to identify suitable kernels for use in lattice gauge theories, particularly in the context of QCD's heavy-dense limit.", "result": "The results include the successful application of a kernel to correct convergence in a toy model, the formulation of a robust correctness condition for complex Langevin simulations, and the presentation of initial findings from applying a machine learning approach to select kernels for lattice gauge theories, specifically in the heavy-dense QCD scenario.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the use of kernels shows promise in solving convergence problems in complex Langevin simulations, and that the newly derived correctness condition provides a more rigorous assessment of simulation outcomes. The machine learning-based approach for kernel selection is suggested as a potential avenue for further research, especially in the field of lattice QCD."}}
