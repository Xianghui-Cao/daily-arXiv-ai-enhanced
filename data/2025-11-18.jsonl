The lattice QCD simulations are carried out on four $2+1$ flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles generated by the CLQCD collaboration, with a lattice spacing $a=0.07746$ fm and two different pion masses, $M_π\\sim 210$ and $\\sim 300~\\mathrm{MeV}$. Energy levels are extracted for four single channels, $Ω_{cc}\\bar{K}^{(-2,1/2)}$, $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,1)}$, $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$, and $Ξ_{cc}π^{(0,3/2)}$, where the superscripts $(S,I)$ denote strangeness $S$ and isospin $I$. Our results indicate that the $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ channel is attractive, exhibiting negative energy shifts relative to the non-interacting two-hadron thresholds, while the other three channels are repulsive. Using Lüscher's finite-volume formula, we extract the near-threshold phase shifts and determine the $S$-wave scattering lengths. Furthermore, a virtual state pole is found in the $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ scattering amplitude. These results provide ab initio input to enable high-precision studies of the properties and spectroscopy of doubly heavy baryons."}

In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly in the sampled gauge configurations, then lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible."}
