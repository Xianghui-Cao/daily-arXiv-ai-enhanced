Using\nthe formalism developed in Ref.~\\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of\nsynthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is\ndemonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\\\"uscher approach, the\ntruncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final\nresult. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified\nL\\\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising\nwithin the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization\nscheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range\nexpansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves."}
