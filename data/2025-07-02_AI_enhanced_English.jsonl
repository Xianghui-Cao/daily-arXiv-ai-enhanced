In the large $N,\nN_f$ limit mean field gives the exact solution, and the core of the Polyakov\nloop model is reduced to a deformed unitary matrix model, which I solve\nexactly. I compute the free energy, the expectation value of the Polyakov loop,\nand the quark condensate. The phase diagram of the model and the type of phase\ntransition is investigated and shows it depends on the ratio $\\kappa =N_f/N$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
