### [1] [Symanzik Effective Action for Karsten-Wilczek Minimally Doubled Fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09690)
*Kunal Shukre,Subhasish Basak*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper constructs the Symanzik effective action for Karsten-Wilczek (KW) fermions, which are a type of minimally doubled fermions. It makes the two fermionic modes (tastes) explicit using point-splitting and identifies the symmetries to write down the effective action up to dimension-5, including divergent dimension-3 operators for both free and interacting KW fermions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of KW fermions by constructing their Symanzik effective action, taking into account the broken hypercubic symmetry and the explicit tastes in the point-splitting formalism.

Method: The authors use the point-splitting proposal of Creutz and Misumi to make the two fermionic modes (tastes) explicit and then construct the Symanzik effective action for the KW fermions, including the identification of the symmetries of the point-split action and the writing of the effective action up to dimension-5 with divergent dimension-3 operators.

Result: The result is the Symanzik effective action for KW fermions, written in terms of the taste fields, with the inclusion of all relevant operators up to dimension-5, and the recognition of the symmetries of the point-split action.

Conclusion: The conclusion would be that the Symanzik effective action for KW fermions has been successfully constructed, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of these fermions on the lattice, particularly regarding the role of the taste degrees of freedom and the impact of the broken hypercubic symmetry.

Abstract: Karsten-Wilczek (KW) fermions are a popular variant of minimally doubled
fermions. We construct Symanzik effective action for KW fermions, which is
known to break the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice action. In this work we
make the two fermionic modes, called tastes, explicit using the point-splitting
proposal of Creutz and Misumi and write the KW action in terms of the taste
fields. We identify the symmetries of the point-split action and write down the
Symanzik effective action up to dimension-5, including the divergent
dimension-3, operators for both free and interacting KW fermions.

### [2] [Tensor-network formulation of QCD in the strong-coupling expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09891)
*Thomas Samberger,Jacques Bloch,Robert Lohmayer,Tilo Wettig*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of QCD with staggered quarks, enabling analytical computation of key physical quantities on a small lattice, and sets the stage for future work on larger lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that can handle the strong-coupling expansion of QCD at non-zero chemical potential, which is a challenging problem due to the sign problem in traditional lattice QCD simulations, and to pave the way for more efficient computations on larger lattices.

Method: The authors formulate the QCD partition function as a tensor network after integrating out gauge and quark degrees of freedom. They then truncate the tensor at a specific order in the inverse coupling and derive analytical results for the partition function, free energy, and chiral condensate on a 2x2 lattice up to a certain order in the expansion.

Result: Analytical expressions for the partition function, free energy, and chiral condensate are derived up to the fourth order in the inverse coupling (Î²^4) for a 2x2 lattice. The groundwork is laid for an enhanced tensor-network method to be introduced in a follow-up study, which will allow for the computation of these quantities on larger lattices.

Conclusion: The tensor-network formulation provides a new avenue for tackling the strong-coupling regime of QCD, offering a way to circumvent the sign problem and compute physical observables. The proposed method is shown to be feasible for small lattices, and it is anticipated that the forthcoming enhanced method will extend its applicability to larger lattices.

Abstract: We present a tensor-network formulation for the strong-coupling expansion of
QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential, for arbitrary number
of dimensions, colors, and flavors. We integrate out the gauge and quark
degrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of
a tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a
numerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order
in the inverse coupling $\beta$ and compute analytical results for the
partition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\times2$
lattice up to order $\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an
enhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute
the expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices.

### [3] [Thermodynamics of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09927)
*Kei Tohme,Takahiro M. Doi,Masakiyo Kitazawa,Krzysztof Redlich,Chihiro Sasaki*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper examines the thermodynamic properties of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD on the lattice, using a hopping parameter expansion to calculate the grand potential and quark number susceptibilities. It also explores baryonic and quark mode excitation properties in both confined and deconfined phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the thermodynamic behavior and phase transitions of heavy-quark QCD by analyzing the fermionic excitations and their properties in different phases, which is crucial for a deeper insight into the strong interaction dynamics.

Method: The method involves an analytical calculation of the grand potential using the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) and cumulant expansion, followed by the computation of quark number susceptibilities and their ratios. The study also applies Boltzmann statistics to investigate the excitation properties of baryonic and quark modes.

Result: Results include the calculation of quark number susceptibility ratios, with the ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities being unity in the deconfined phase and nine in the confined phase at leading order. An analytic formula for the quark excitation energy in the deconfined phase is derived, and baryonic excitation energies are decomposed into flavor multiplets in the confined phase.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely emphasize the significance of the findings for understanding the thermodynamics of heavy-quark QCD, the role of the HPE in capturing the physics of the system, and the implications of the results for the quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of fermionic excitations in
heavy-quark QCD on the lattice with Wilson fermions. The grand potential is
calculated analytically in the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) on the basis
of the cumulant expansion. Using the grand potential, we compute the quark
number susceptibilities and their ratios up to next-to-leading order in the
HPE. The ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities is shown to be unity
(nine) in the deconfined (confined) phase at the leading order. Excitation
properties of baryonic and quark modes in each phase are also investigated
utilizing the Boltzmann statistics. We obtain an analytic formula for the quark
excitation energy in the deconfined phase, while that for baryonic excitations
in the confined phase is decomposed into flavor multiplets.
