Motivation: The need to accurately reconstruct ground-state energy and matrix elements from correlators in lattice QCD is hampered by the presence of statistical noise, which this paper aims to address with a new approach.

Method: The authors introduce a low-rank approximation technique based on singular-value decomposition (SVD) applied to a matrix of correlators. The method involves diagonalizing the transfer matrix within a Krylov subspace and then extrapolating to eliminate bias due to the variance of energy eigenvalues.

Result: The proposed method was tested on both simulated (mock) data and actual $K$ and $D_s$ meson correlator data, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the impact of statistical noise on the reconstruction of ground-state properties.

Conclusion: The low-rank approximation method, combined with SVD and an extrapolation procedure, provides a viable solution to the problem of statistical noise in the reconstruction of ground-state energy and matrix elements in lattice QCD, as evidenced by the analysis of both artificial and real-world data.

Abstract: Ground-state energy and matrix element are reconstructed from correlators in
lattice QCD by diagonalizing transfer matrix $\hat{T}$ within the Krylov
subspace spanned by $\hat{T}^n|\chi\rangle$, where $|\chi\rangle$ is a state
generated by an interpolating field on the lattice. In numerical applications,
this strategy is spoiled by statistical noise. To circumvent the problem, we
introduce a low-rank approximation based on a singular-value decomposition of a
matrix made of the correlators. The associated bias is eliminated by an
extrapolation to the limit of vanishing variance of energy eigenvalue. The
strategy is tested using a set of mock data as well as real data of $K$ and
$D_s$ meson correlators.
