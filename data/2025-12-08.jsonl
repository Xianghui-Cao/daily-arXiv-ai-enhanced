Brandt", "Volodymyr Chelnokov", "Francesca Cuteri", "Gergely Endrődi"], "title": "QCD phase structure at finite isospin chemical potential and smaller-than-physical quark mass", "comment": "4 pages, 2 figures, talk presented at the Quark Matter 2025 conference, April 6th - April 12th, 2025, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany", "summary": "Introduction of a nonzero isospin chemical potential in QCD leads to the emergence of a pion condensed phase at sufficiently large $μ_I$, bounded by a second order transition line. At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $μ_I = m_π/ 2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $μ_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario."}

The analysis covers a wide range of temperatures both above and below the chiral crossover, and explores varying quark-antiquark distances, with the aim of identifying signals of deconfinement and string breaking in the field structure. To this end we apply the zero-curl perturbative field subtraction method, developed in our earlier studies of pure gauge SU(3) theory and of full QCD at zero temperature."}
