### [1] [Empirical investigation of nuclear correlation function distributions in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20378)
*William Detmold,Rohan Kanchana,Cagin Yunus*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the two-point correlation functions in lattice QCD for baryon numbers 1 to 4, comparing them with theoretical distributions from simpler models like the O(N) model. It finds that O(N) model distributions accurately describe QCD distributions at zero momentum and large temporal separations, with N approximately 2/B.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of two-point correlation functions in QCD, a more complex theory, by drawing parallels with known results from simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the O(N) model, where asymptotic expressions for correlation function distributions have been established.

Method: The method involves using importance-sampling Monte-Carlo techniques to generate empirical distributions of two-point correlation functions for various baryon numbers on a lattice. These empirical QCD distributions are then compared against the theoretical distributions from the O(N) model using statistical tests.

Result: The result is that the O(N) model distributions match well with the empirical QCD distributions over a broad range of temporal separations, particularly when the baryon number B is considered, with N being roughly 2/B. This agreement holds true for zero-momentum conditions and large temporal separations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the O(N) model, with N approximately 2/B, provides a good approximation for the two-point correlation functions in QCD, which can be used to predict the behavior of these functions at large temporal separations.

Abstract: Two-point correlation functions of systems with baryon number $B \in
\{1,2,3,4\}$ are investigated using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In
particular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo
samples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the
spacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the
exact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has
determined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function
distributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the
disordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions
are found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions
at zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon
number when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In
particular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at
large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \sim 2/B)$ model
distribution.

### [2] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper introduces Effective String Theory (EST) and a new numerical approach using deep learning to explore EST, presenting results on the width of the Nambu-Goto EST.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of certain problems in EST, such as determining the flux tube width, which cannot be solved analytically, by introducing a novel numerical method based on deep learning.

Method: The authors use a numerical approach that employs deep learning techniques, specifically generative algorithms, to explore Effective String Theory and calculate the width of the confining flux tube described by the Nambu-Goto action.

Result: The result is the determination of the width of the Nambu-Goto EST flux tube through the application of the proposed deep learning-based numerical method.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that deep learning can be a viable tool for numerically exploring Effective String Theory, allowing for the calculation of properties like the flux tube width, which are otherwise difficult to determine analytically.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.
