An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a quantum simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states using a QCD-inspired chiral quark model, finding deeply bound states in the isoscalar channel with results consistent with classical predictions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore exotic multiquark states, specifically bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquarks, through quantum simulation as a novel approach beyond conventional methods.", "method": "The authors use a 16-qubit register to map an effective four-quark Hamiltonian, incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations, and apply a variational quantum eigensolver to identify low-lying S-wave sector states.", "result": "Deeply bound states are found in the isoscalar I(J^P)=0(1^+) channel, with color-singlet meson-meson components and significant hidden-color contributions.
