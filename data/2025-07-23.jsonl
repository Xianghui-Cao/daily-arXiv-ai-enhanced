Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-,\nthree-, and four-hadron operators, covering all irreducible representations of\nthe relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The\nconstruction procedure has been implemented in the open-source package\n\\texttt{OpTion} (Operator construcTion), available at\nhttps://github.com/wittscien/OpTion. The paper and the package are designed to\nserve as a practical and extensible dictionary for future lattice QCD studies,\nas lattice calculations advance towards increasingly complex hadronic systems."}

By\nincorporating the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, chiral transformations, and the\nMajorana condition for gluinos, we construct a consistent framework that\npreserves a lattice-modified chiral symmetry and reduces the number of required\ncounterterms compared to Wilson-type discretizations. The formulation\nintroduces auxiliary fermionic fields to realize exact chiral symmetry in\nYukawa interactions and enables a detailed analysis of the resulting matrix\nstructures. Upon functionally integrating out the auxiliary fields, ultralocal\ninteraction terms emerge as new contributions to the lattice action. This\napproach provides a robust foundation for nonperturbative lattice studies of\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. Future work will focus on computing all\nperturbative fine-tunings required in this formulation to enable continuum\nmatching and numerical simulations of SQCD."}
