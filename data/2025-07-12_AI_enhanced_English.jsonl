The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the\nscalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the\nglobal symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous\nbreaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the\nmodel. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling\nare examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial\nsymmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300\nto 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning\nbare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$\nbosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of\nthe $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are\nexplored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated\nlower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and\nindependent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak\ntransition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing\nproperties of a smooth crossover behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model using non-perturbative lattice calculations, showing spontaneous breaking of custodial symmetry and studying the spectrum, running of the gauge coupling, and finite temperature electroweak transition.", "motivation": "The motivation is to study the enlarged scalar spectrum and the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry in the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which has the same global-symmetry properties as the standard model.", "method": "Non-perturbative lattice calculations are used with energy cutoffs from 300 to 600 GeV, while maintaining a line of constant standard model physics by tuning bare couplings. The research examines the spectrum, the running of the gauge coupling, and the finite temperature electroweak transition.", "result": "Spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry is observed within a certain region of the parameter space. The additional scalar states have realizable masses, with an estimated lower bound that is well below the W boson mass. The electroweak transition at finite temperatures shows a smooth crossover behavior.", "conclusion": "The analysis provides insights into the dynamics of the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, indicating the presence of new physics with spontaneously broken custodial symmetry and the potential for light additional scalars. The results also suggest a smooth crossover during the electroweak phase transition."}}
