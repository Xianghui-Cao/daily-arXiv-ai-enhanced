Motivation: To investigate the properties of the quantum Ising model on a hyperbolic lattice within an anti-de Sitter space, including its phase diagram and entanglement characteristics, which can provide insights into the nature of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes.

Method: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) are utilized alongside the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to find the ground state and explore the bulk phase diagram. The researchers also compute the boundary theory's density matrix and measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs).

Result: A phase transition is identified between disordered and ordered phases. The boundary-boundary spin correlation function shows power law scaling in the disordered phase, consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. Entanglement entropy follows a logarithmic dependence at the critical point but exhibits linear scaling away from it, while the full system displays volume law scaling. OTOCs are used to analyze the scrambling behavior of the system.

Conclusion: The research provides a deeper understanding of the quantum Ising model in (2+1)D anti-de Sitter space, revealing a phase transition and specific scaling behaviors of the entanglement entropy that depend on the phase of the system. It also offers insight into the chaotic and highly connected nature of the system through the analysis of OTOCs.

Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper provides an update on the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, using lattice QCD simulations with physical pion mass and including strange- and charm-quark connected contributions, as well as light-quark connected and disconnected contributions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for the muon's anomalous magnetic moment by refining the calculations of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution, which is one of the least understood parts in the Standard Model calculation of the muon g-2.

Method: The method used in this paper involves employing ETMC's N_f=2+1+1 Wilson-clover twisted-mass fermions at the physical point. The researchers have carried out continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected diagrams and provided results for the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected diagrams at a single lattice spacing.

Result: The results include updated values for the HLbL contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, with particular focus on the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions that have been extrapolated to the continuum limit, and preliminary findings for the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a fixed lattice spacing.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is not explicitly stated in the abstract, but it can be inferred that the authors have made progress in reducing the uncertainty of the HLbL contribution to the muon g-2, which will help in testing the Standard Model and potentially revealing new physics through more precise comparisons with experimental data.

Abstract: We present updated results for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The calculations are based on ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles at the physical point. We perform continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and report on our results for the light-quark connected and light-quark 2+2 disconnected contributions at one lattice spacing.
