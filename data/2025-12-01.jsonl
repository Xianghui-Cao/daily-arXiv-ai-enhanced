Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a =(0.052-0.105$) fm, and pion mass $m_π \\approx (136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\\perp} \\sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits. This work yields the most precise nonperturbative constraint on the CS kernel's long-distance behavior from Lattice QCD, which not only bridges Lattice QCD, perturbation theory, and nucleon structure experiments for TMD studies, but also boosts the utility of our constraint for future global TMD analyses."}

The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics."}

A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential has been revealed. In a high-density regime, we can see a superfluid phase, where the diquark condensate takes a non-zero expectation value. We have newly found that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal bound, which is the value of the relativistic free theory.
