### [1] [Critical coupling in $φ_2^4$ theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16536)
*Stephan Durr,Tolga S. H. Kiel*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the $φ^4$ theory in two Euclidean dimensions, determining the critical bare mass for various self-couplings and the universal parameter $f_\mathrm{c}$, which is found to be 11.1097(22).

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phase transition in the $φ^4$ theory from a symmetric to a broken phase by identifying the critical bare mass and the universal parameter $f_\mathrm{c}$.

Method: The method involves lattice regularization to study the system's behavior at different self-couplings, and then extrapolating the results to an infinite volume with a universal scheme using the renormalized parameter.

Result: The result is the determination of the critical bare mass for various self-couplings and the value of the universal parameter $f_\mathrm{c} = 11.1097(22)$, including statistical and systematic uncertainties.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the critical value $f_\mathrm{c}$ has been determined with high precision, providing a deeper understanding of the phase transition in the $φ^4$ theory.

Abstract: We consider $φ^4$ theory with $φ(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hatλ$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hatμ_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hatλ)$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hatλ\to0}\hatλ/\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.

### [2] [Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16863)
*Thomas Appelquist,James Ingoldby,Maurizio Piai*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper uses dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) to analyze lattice data from gauge theories, distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal behaviors. It concludes that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions shows confinement, while the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion exhibits infrared conformal behavior.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a diagnostic tool using dEFT to distinguish between near-conformal yet confining theories and those exhibiting infrared conformality, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of gauge theories close to the conformal window's lower edge.

Method: The authors apply dEFT to two sets of existing lattice data: one from an $SU(3)$ theory with 8 flavors of fundamental Dirac fermions and another from an $SU(2)$ theory with a single adjoint fermion. They use dEFT to fit the lattice data and infer the nature of the theories based on these fits.

Result: For the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions, the analysis indicates confinement, while for the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion, the results favor infrared conformal behavior. The study suggests that dEFT can be a useful method for diagnosing the phase of gauge theories from lattice data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by suggesting that further lattice measurements and refinements in the analysis could test and strengthen the framework provided by dEFT for diagnosing the phases of gauge theories.

Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.
