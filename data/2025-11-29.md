Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.

### [2] [The Fredenhagen-Marcu operator in the gauge-Higgs Z(2) LGT at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21166)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The Fredenhagen-Marcu operator is evaluated through numerical simulations in a (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields. The results suggest that this operator can serve as an order parameter to differentiate between deconfinement, Higgs, and confinement phases.

Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the potential of the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator to act as an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in systems with gauge and matter fields at finite temperature.

Method: The method involves numerical simulations of the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory that includes Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields, with the calculation of the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator within this setup.

Result: The result indicates that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can effectively distinguish the deconfinement phase from the Higgs and confinement phases in the considered gauge-matter system.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator is a viable order parameter for identifying the deconfinement phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields.

Abstract: We explore the possibility to use the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator as an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in gauge-matter systems at finite temperature. Concretely, we compute by numerical simulations this operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields. Our conclusion is that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can indeed serve as an order parameter capable of distinguishing the deconfinement phase from the Higgs and confinement phases of the theory.
