*Dian-Jun Zhao,Long Chen,Hongxin Dong,Xiangdong Ji,Liuming Liu,Zhuoyi Pang,Peng Sun,Yi-Bo Yang,Jian-Hui Zhang,Shiyi Zhong*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation to determine the gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, ΔG, using advanced techniques such as distillation, momentum smearing, and non-perturbative renormalization. The results suggest that ΔG constitutes about 46% of the proton spin.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accurately calculate the total gluon helicity contribution (ΔG) to the proton spin, which is an important aspect of understanding the internal structure and dynamics of the proton in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Method: The method involves performing lattice QCD calculations at three different lattice spacings, utilizing distillation and momentum smearing for the proton external states, and applying a non-perturbative RI/MOM renormalization scheme with CDER to determine the renormalization constants of the topological current K^μ. The calculations are done under 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations, and the results are extrapolated to the continuum limit.

Result: The result is that the gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, ΔG, is found to be 0.231(17)(stat.)(33)(sym.) at the MS̅ scale μ^2=10 GeV^2, which represents approximately 46(7)% of the proton spin. The findings are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this study is that the gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin is significant, accounting for nearly half of the total spin, and the methods used provide a robust determination of ΔG with controlled systematic errors.

Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin, $ΔG$. The calculation is done on ensembles at three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation + momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^μ$ under the 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented with the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^μ$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $ΔG$ is found to be $ΔG = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(33)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale $μ^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(7)\%$ of the proton spin.

### [2] [Implementing the three-neutron quantization condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24508)
*Wilder Schaaf,Stephen R. Sharpe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a detailed implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition, including Wigner rotations and angular momenta restrictions. It provides numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum with parameters close to physical conditions, suggesting that precise lattice QCD calculations can yield information on two- and three-particle interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to implement the theoretical framework for the relativistic three-neutron system in a finite volume, as derived in a previous reference, and to show how lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations can provide insights into both two- and three-particle interactions.

Method: The method involves incorporating the effects of Wigner rotations on spins, formulating concrete expressions for angular momenta within pairs less than 2, and decomposing solutions into irreducible representations of doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. Additionally, it includes the development of a three-particle K matrix with the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion, and the generation of numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum using near-physical parameters and experimental data for two-particle interactions.

Result: The results include a successful implementation of the three-neutron quantization condition, an analysis of the symmetries of the matrices involved, and numerical predictions for the finite-volume energy spectrum. The study demonstrates the potential of high-precision lattice QCD calculations to inform about multi-particle interactions.

Conclusion: The exploratory study concludes that with sufficient precision, lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions, which could be used to further our understanding of nuclear forces.

Abstract: We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions.

### [3] [Symmetric mass generation as a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24836)
*Sandip Maiti,Debasish Banerjee,Shailesh Chandrasekharan,Marina K. Marinkovic*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the phase diagram of a lattice fermion model, identifying three distinct phases and the transitions between them. It uses the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method to find evidence for second-order critical points and a multicritical point where these merge, leading to a direct transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phase structure of a lattice fermion model, particularly the nature of the transitions between different phases and the existence of a direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases when the symmetry breaking parameter is zero.

Method: The researchers used the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices to study the phase diagram and the critical behavior of the system, focusing on the identification of the critical points and the multicritical point.

Result: The results indicate the presence of traditional second-order critical points that separate the massless fermion (MF) phase from the massive fermion phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), and the latter two from the massive fermion phase with symmetric mass generation (SMG). The critical points merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry, confirming the direct second-order transition between the MF and SMG phases when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there are clear distinctions in the phase diagram of the lattice fermion model, with well-defined critical points and a multicritical point, which supports the existence of a direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.

Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of a lattice fermion model that exhibits three distinct phases: a massless fermion (MF) phase; a massive fermion phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a fermion bilinear condensate; and a massive fermion phase with symmetric mass generation (SMG). Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices, we find evidence for traditional second-order critical points separating the first two and the latter two phases. Remarkably, these critical points appear to merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, giving rise to the recently discovered direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.
