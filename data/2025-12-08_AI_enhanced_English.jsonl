At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\u03bc_I = m_\u03c0/ 2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\u03bc_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study uses lattice QCD simulations to investigate pion condensation at a nonzero isospin chemical potential, finding that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to its intersection with the chiral crossover, even as the light quark mass decreases, supporting the scenario where pion condensation occurs at any nonzero isospin chemical potential in the chiral limit below the chiral transition temperature.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore the behavior of the pion condensation boundary at different light quark masses and to test if the pion condensation can happen at any nonzero isospin chemical potential when the light quark mass approaches zero, which is relevant for understanding the phase structure of QCD at finite isospin density.", "method": "The researchers perform a lattice QCD simulation with 2+1 flavors at a nonzero isospin chemical potential, using a smaller-than-physical light quark mass, to study the pion condensation phenomenon and its relation to the chiral crossover line.", "result": "The results show that the pion condensation boundary stays vertical until it meets the chiral crossover line, even with a reduced light quark mass, indicating that in the chiral limit, pion condensation would occur at any nonzero value of the isospin chemical potential below the chiral transition temperature.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the findings support the hypothesis that in the chiral limit, pion condensation takes place at an arbitrary nonzero isospin chemical potential for temperatures below the chiral transition, consistent with the observed behavior at physical quark masses."}}

The analysis covers a wide range of temperatures both above and below the chiral crossover, and explores varying quark-antiquark distances, with the aim of identifying signals of deconfinement and string breaking in the field structure. To this end we apply the zero-curl perturbative field subtraction method, developed in our earlier studies of pure gauge SU(3) theory and of full QCD at zero temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study investigates the chromoelectrical field structure from a quark-antiquark pair in lattice QCD with 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks, across a range of temperatures, using a zero-curl perturbative field subtraction method to identify deconfinement and string breaking signals.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of the chromoelectrical field created by a static quark-antiquark pair at different temperatures and distances, and to identify signs of deconfinement and string breaking, which are important for understanding the phase transitions in QCD.", "method": "The researchers use lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks at their physical masses.
