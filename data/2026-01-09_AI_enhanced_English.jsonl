Ye"], "title": "QCD Crossover at Low Temperatures from Lee-Yang Edge Singularity", "comment": "18 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "We provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line down to $T\\simeq108$~MeV. We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $\u03bc_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\\!+\\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $\u03bc_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $\u03bc_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\\{T,\u03bc_B\\}$ and the scaling variable (\\textit{i.e.}\\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$\u03bc_B$ expansion, the resulting $\u03bc_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $\u03bc_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$\u03bc_B$ regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a new method combining Lee-Yang edge and universal chiral scaling to estimate the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures as a function of baryon chemical potential, \u03bc_B, down to T \u2248 108 MeV. The results are consistent with existing lattice-QCD determinations and heavy-ion collision parameters, suggesting the method's robustness and its potential for mapping the QCD phase diagram in low-T, high-\u03bc_B regions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line at lower temperatures (down to T \u2248 108 MeV) and to establish a method that can be used to determine the \u03bc_B dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures without relying on small-\u03bc_B expansions.", "method": "The authors developed a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential (\u03bc_B) with universal chiral scaling. They performed (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at T \u2248 108 MeV with purely imaginary \u03bc_B, using a single lattice spacing and two different volumes. From these, they calculated \u03bc_B-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and determined the location of the Lee-Yang edge, which, along with the universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, was used to define a mapping function between {T, \u03bc_B} and the scaling variable.", "result": "The result is an estimation of the \u03bc_B dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for T \u2265 108 MeV. The derived \u03bc_B dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature aligns with previous lattice-QCD findings at small \u03bc_B and with chemical freeze-out parameters from heavy-ion collisions, even at low temperatures, indicating the reliability of the method.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the new method is valid and robust, as it provides consistent results with established determinations and experimental data. It opens up the possibility for further investigations into the QCD phase diagram, particularly in the low-temperature, high-baryon-chemical-potential regime, by systematically extending the application of this method to other temperatures and discretizations."}}
