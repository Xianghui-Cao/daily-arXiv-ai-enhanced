Using the excited state masses in the $\\pi$ and $\\rho$\nchannels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge\ntrajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the\nmagnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\\infty$\nresults with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits\nlarge-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several\nvalues of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several\nvalues of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral\nextrapolations."}

It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean\naction of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in\nclassical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant,\nnon-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations\nof lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge\ntheories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated\ntemperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator\naccurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range\nof lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a\ngeneral-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential\napplications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time\nmonitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms."}
