Motivation: To investigate the quantum Ising model on hyperbolic lattices within an anti-de Sitter space, aiming to understand the bulk phase diagram, boundary-boundary spin correlations, and scrambling dynamics through the lens of entanglement and out-of-time-ordered correlators.

Method: Utilized Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) alongside the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to find the ground state and explore the properties of the model up to 232 sites. The researchers computed the density matrix for the boundary theory by tracing out bulk indices and measured Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs).

Result: Discovered a phase transition between disordered and ordered phases, with power law scaling of boundary-boundary spin correlation in the disordered phase. At the critical point, the entanglement entropy showed logarithmic dependence on boundary length, while away from it, linear scaling was observed. The full system displayed volume law scaling. OTOCs were used to analyze the scrambling behavior of the system.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the quantum Ising model's behavior on hyperbolic lattices, including its phase transitions, entanglement properties, and chaotic dynamics, contributing to the understanding of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes.

Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

TL;DR: This paper updates the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment using ETMC's Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles, with continuum extrapolations for strange and charm quark contributions, and results for light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a single lattice spacing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for the muon's anomalous magnetic moment by refining the calculation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution, which is one of the largest uncertainties in the Standard Model predictions.

Method: The method involves using ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass fermion ensembles at the physical point, performing continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected diagrams, and reporting on the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected diagrams at one lattice spacing.

Result: The paper provides updated numerical results for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions after continuum extrapolation, as well as preliminary results for the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a fixed lattice spacing.

Conclusion: The study concludes with an improved understanding of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, contributing to the reduction of theoretical uncertainties in the Standard Model predictions.

Abstract: We present updated results for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The calculations are based on ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles at the physical point. We perform continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and report on our results for the light-quark connected and light-quark 2+2 disconnected contributions at one lattice spacing.
