In numerical applications,\nthis strategy is spoiled by statistical noise. To circumvent the problem, we\nintroduce a low-rank approximation based on a singular-value decomposition of a\nmatrix made of the correlators. The associated bias is eliminated by an\nextrapolation to the limit of vanishing variance of energy eigenvalue. The\nstrategy is tested using a set of mock data as well as real data of $K$ and\n$D_s$ meson correlators.", "AI": {"tldr": "A method for reconstructing ground-state energy and matrix elements in lattice QCD using a low-rank approximation to reduce statistical noise, with testing on mock and real meson correlator data.", "motivation": "The need to accurately reconstruct ground-state energy and matrix elements from correlators in lattice QCD is hampered by the presence of statistical noise, which this paper aims to address with a new approach.", "method": "The authors introduce a low-rank approximation technique based on singular-value decomposition (SVD) applied to a matrix of correlators. The method involves diagonalizing the transfer matrix within a Krylov subspace and then extrapolating to eliminate bias due to the variance of energy eigenvalues.", "result": "The proposed method was tested on both simulated (mock) data and actual $K$ and $D_s$ meson correlator data, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the impact of statistical noise on the reconstruction of ground-state properties.", "conclusion": "The low-rank approximation method, combined with SVD and an extrapolation procedure, provides a viable solution to the problem of statistical noise in the reconstruction of ground-state energy and matrix elements in lattice QCD, as evidenced by the analysis of both artificial and real-world data."}}
