Proceeding of Quark matter 2025", "summary": "Finite density lattice QCD usually relies on extrapolations in baryon chemical potential ($μ_B$), be it Taylor expansion, T' expansion (\\cite{Borsanyi:2021sxv}) or analytical continuation. However, their range of validity is difficult to control. In the canonical formulation, the baryon density is the parameter of the system, not $μ_B$. Here we demonstrate that we can access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses. We present first results with both the strangeness ($n_S$) and baryon ($n_B$) densities as parameters. Specifically, we compute the QCD pressure and chemical potentials as functions of $n_B$ and $n_S$. Our computations rely on high-statistics simulations with 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions."}

We adopt staggered fermions and extract $\\ell_{\\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting by suitably generalizing the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 074513] for the Wilson discretization. Adopting 12 gauge ensembles with 3 different values of the pion mass, and 4 different values of the lattice spacing, we are able to achieve controlled extrapolations towards the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits. Our final result $\\ell_{\\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \\,\\times \\, 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\rm stat}}(26)_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\rm tot}}$ agrees with and substantially improves on previous determinations."}
