### [1] [Comment on the claim of physical irrelevance of the topological term](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10127)
*Tanmoy Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper corrects a misunderstanding about the absence of CP-violating effects in QCD, asserting that the established results are accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify and rectify a misconception regarding the claim that there are no CP-violating effects due to a topological term in QCD, thus reinforcing the validity of the standard results in the field.

Method: The method is not explicitly stated in the abstract; it can be inferred that the authors employ theoretical analysis and argumentation to support their position on the topic of CP violation in QCD.

Result: The result is the assertion that the standard understanding and results concerning CP violation in QCD are indeed correct, contrary to the misunderstood claim of the absence of such effects.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the existing body of work and the standard results in QCD regarding CP violation are reaffirmed, and the previous claim suggesting otherwise is based on a misunderstanding.

Abstract: We argue that the claim of the absence of charge-conjugation-parity (CP) violating effects due to a topological term in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is based upon a misunderstanding, and the standard results in the field are correct.

### [2] [QCD on the 16-cell honeycomb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10604)
*Sandor D. Katz,Daniel Nogradi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores QCD on a 16-cell honeycomb lattice, demonstrating improved rotational symmetry, scaling properties, and chiral and topological characteristics compared to the traditional cubic lattice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve a higher degree of rotational symmetry and reduce cut-off effects in QCD by using a 16-cell honeycomb lattice instead of a traditional cubic lattice, which allows for more accurate simulations at larger lattice spacings.

Method: The method involves formulating QCD on a four-dimensional 16-cell honeycomb lattice and comparing it with the standard cubic lattice. The study is conducted in quenched QCD, and both gluonic and fermionic observables are used to assess the scaling properties and other physical attributes.

Result: The results show that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice provides superior scaling properties and much smaller cut-off effects, allowing for controlled continuum extrapolations at larger lattice spacings. Additionally, there is a notable improvement in the chiral and topological properties.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the 16-cell honeycomb lattice offers a significant advantage over the traditional cubic lattice for QCD simulations, particularly in terms of reduced cut-off effects, better scaling, and improved chiral and topological features, making it a promising alternative for future studies.

Abstract: We formulate QCD discretized on the four dimensional 16-cell honeycomb. The advantage is a higher degree of rotational symmetry as compared to a traditional cubic lattice leading to much smaller cut-off effects. We demonstrate in quenched QCD, through both gluonic and fermionic observables, that the scaling properties are indeed superior to the cubic lattice and much larger lattice spacings are sufficient for controlled continuum extrapolations. Chiral and topological properties also show remarkable improvement.

### [3] [Investigating a two-level algorithm for fermionic observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10644)
*Lorenzo Barca,Jacob Finkenrath,Stefan Schaefer*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores a method that combines a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques to calculate disconnected fermionic correlation functions, demonstrating an exponential reduction in statistical errors while maintaining computational efficiency. The method is validated using pure gauge ensembles and shows promise for future QCD studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the calculation of disconnected fermionic correlation functions by reducing statistical errors and maintaining computational cost, which is essential for precise studies in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), particularly for glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions.

Method: A two-level sampling algorithm is combined with distillation techniques, and the quark propagator is factored into domain-local contributions. This allows for independent submeasurements of each term, leading to estimators with reduced variance and enhanced precision.

Result: The results show that the two-level estimators have the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, with exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction in statistical errors. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through tests on pure gauge ensembles, setting a benchmark for its application in dynamical QCD studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces statistical errors in the computation of disconnected fermionic correlation functions, making it a promising tool for future QCD research, especially for complex systems like glueballs and isosinglet mesons.

Abstract: We investigate the combination of a two-level sampling algorithm with distillation techniques to compute disconnected fermionic correlation functions. The method relies on a factorization of the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that depend only on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions, enabling independent submeasurements of each term through a two-level sampling strategy. The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method is tested on pure gauge ensembles, providing a controlled benchmark for its forthcoming application to dynamical QCD studies of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions.

### [4] [Equation of state, QCD phase diagram: predictions from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10760)
*Bastian B. Brandt*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper reviews recent findings on the phase structure and equation of state of strong interaction matter from lattice QCD, focusing on areas where direct simulations are feasible with controlled systematic effects, and discusses the progress towards understanding non-zero baryochemical potential regions using indirect methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an overview of the current status and recent advancements in the study of the phase structure and equation of state of strong interaction matter, particularly through lattice QCD simulations, and to highlight the challenges and approaches in studying systems with non-zero baryochemical potentials.

Method: The review is based on a compilation of recent results from lattice QCD studies. It emphasizes the analysis of data obtained from direct simulations under conditions where systematic errors can be managed. For non-zero baryochemical potentials, where direct simulations are not possible, the paper examines the use of indirect methods to infer properties of the system.

Result: The review presents a detailed summary of the phase structure and equation of state as determined by lattice QCD, including the critical points and transitions observed. It also outlines the current methodologies for dealing with non-zero baryochemical potentials, such as reweighting techniques and Taylor expansion methods, and the insights gained into the QCD phase diagram.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while significant progress has been made in understanding the phase structure and equation of state at zero baryochemical potential, the region of non-zero baryochemical potentials remains challenging. Indirect methods have provided valuable information, but further development and validation of these techniques are necessary to fully map out the QCD phase diagram.

Abstract: I review recent results on phase structure and equation of state of strong interaction matter from lattice QCD. Particular emphasis is given to the axes where direct simulations are possible and results are obtained with sufficient control over systematic effects. I also discuss the status of approaching the region of non-zero baryochemical potentials using indirect methods.
