Kovacs", "Ferenc Pittler"], "title": "Dirac mode localization in QCD near the crossover temperature", "comment": "12 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\le T_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\le 158\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility."}
