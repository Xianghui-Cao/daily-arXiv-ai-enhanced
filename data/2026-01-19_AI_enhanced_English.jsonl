Using these quantities, the physical point values of the two flow scales, ${t_0^{\\rm Phy}}$ and ${w_0^{\\rm Phy}}$, and the ratio $\\mathop{f_K / f_\u03c0}^{\\rm Phy}$ are determined. The masses of the octet and decuplet baryons are analyzed using both the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ansatz from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB$\u03c7$PT). The NNLO fit to the octet baryons, $M_N$, $M_\u03a3$, $M_\u039b$ and $M_\u039e$, is preferred while the corresponding fits to the decuplet Omega mass, $M_\u03a9$, are not distinguished. We also present a study of the autocorrelations in the data and show that there is no evidence, even at large flow time, of the freezing of the topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents an analysis of meson and baryon spectrum, decay constants, flow scales, and time histories of certain operators under gradient flow using 13 ensembles (NME) with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions. It determines physical point values for flow scales and the ratio of decay constants, and analyzes baryon masses using HB\u03c7PT at NLO and NNLO, finding a preference for the NNLO fit to octet baryons but not for decuplet Omega mass. No evidence of topological charge or Weinberg operator freezing is found.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a detailed analysis of lattice QCD simulations using 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions, focusing on the determination of key physical quantities such as flow scales, decay constants, and baryon masses, as well as to investigate the behavior of topological charge and the Weinberg operator under gradient flow.", "method": "Thirteen ensembles (NME) with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions are used to analyze the meson and baryon spectrum, decay constants, and flow scales.

Baryon masses are analyzed using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB\u03c7PT) at both next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-next-to-leading order (NNLO).", "result": "Physical point values for the two flow scales, t0^Phy and w0^Phy, and the ratio fK/f\u03c0^Phy are determined. The NNLO fit is preferred for the octet baryons M_N, M_\u03a3, M_\u039b, and M_\u039e, while the fits for the decuplet Omega mass, M_\u03a9, do not show a clear distinction. There is no evidence of freezing of the topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator even at large flow times.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the use of the NME ensembles allows for a precise determination of flow scales and decay constant ratios, and provides insights into the baryon mass spectrum through HB\u03c7PT, with a preference for the NNLO ansatz for octet baryons. Additionally, it suggests that the topological charge and the Weinberg operator do not freeze, which is important for understanding the dynamics of QCD at different energy scales."}}

Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper computes renormalization factors for various fields and parameters in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on the lattice, using improved actions to suppress ultraviolet fluctuations, and provides guidance for fine-tuning of lattice simulations.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide more accurate determinations of renormalization factors in N=1 SYM theory through the use of improved lattice actions that can suppress ultraviolet fluctuations, which is important for the setup and calibration of lattice simulations.", "method": "The method involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory with the use of clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links.
