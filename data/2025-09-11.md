*Anosh Joseph,Arpith Kumar*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new reliability test for the complex Langevin method (CLM) is proposed, based on configurational temperature. This estimator, which is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action, directly assesses thermodynamic consistency and can detect various algorithmic issues. The method, validated in one-dimensional models, is extendable to higher dimensions and can improve the robustness of CLM in applications such as lattice QCD at finite density.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the potential convergence to incorrect results in the complex Langevin method (CLM) despite apparent stability, by proposing a more direct and physically interpretable reliability test that probes thermodynamic consistency.

Method: The method involves constructing a configurational temperature estimator from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action, which is then used to check the thermodynamic consistency of the CLM. One-dimensional PT-symmetric models are utilized as a benchmark to validate the precision of the estimator.

Result: The configurational temperature estimator is shown to reproduce the input temperature with high precision and is sensitive enough to detect algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. It is also suggested that the method is applicable to higher-dimensional theories and can be integrated into a hybrid diagnostic framework.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the configurational temperature can serve as a valuable and complementary tool for diagnosing the reliability of the CLM, enhancing its robustness across a range of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite density.

Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising approach to tackle the sign
problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can
converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus
underscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as
monitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,
but they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability
test based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the
gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this
estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a
physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the
estimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use
one-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the
estimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and
incomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method
is readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where
scalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is
tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring
can also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our
results suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a
hybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide
range of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite
density.
