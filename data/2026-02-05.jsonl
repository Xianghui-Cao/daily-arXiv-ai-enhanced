Recently, multiple predictions for hadron structure functions have been derived and compared with experimental measurements and lattice QCD calculations, finding a general agreement. In order to explore the precision of the instanton liquid model, one has to compare its predictions with non-perturbative simulations in a regime dominated by instanton dynamics. This has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and the strong running coupling constant. In this contribution, we propose to study a fermionic observable, the pion electromagnetic form factor, for which instanton liquid model predictions have been discussed in Phys.Rev.D 109, 074029. We use the Wilson flow to single out the dominant contribution from the instantons out of a lattice QCD configuration ensemble. We describe the details of our numerical setup, and some first, preliminary results."}
