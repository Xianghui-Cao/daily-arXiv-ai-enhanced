Using the excited state masses in the $\\pi$ and $\\rho$\nchannels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge\ntrajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the\nmagnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\\infty$\nresults with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits\nlarge-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory.
