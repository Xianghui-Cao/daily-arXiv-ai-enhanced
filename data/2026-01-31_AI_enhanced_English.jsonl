Proceedings of the 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025), TIFR Mumbai, India, 2025", "summary": "The $U(1)_A$ symmetry of the massless QCD Lagrangian is explicitly broken in the quantised theory by the anomaly. It may be effectively restored at some finite temperature, which would have important consequences for the order of the chiral transition and the QCD phase diagram. It has been argued in the literature that one way to probe the effective restoration of $U(1)_A$ is to check for the degeneracy of pseudoscalar and flavour non-singlet scalar correlators. In this work, we consider a new method of examining this degeneracy based upon hadron correlation functions on the anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles. The anisotropic nature and our newest Generation 3 ensembles aid in a determination of the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry which we find to be $T_{U(1)_A} \\sim 320$ MeV, well above the chiral transition temperature, which is $T_{\\rm pc} \\sim 180$ MeV for our choice of Wilson-Clover fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a new method to examine the effective restoration of $U(1)_A$ symmetry in QCD at finite temperatures using hadron correlation functions on anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles. The authors find that the $U(1)_A$ symmetry is effectively restored at a temperature of around 320 MeV, which is significantly higher than the chiral transition temperature of approximately 180 MeV for their choice of Wilson-Clover fermions.", "motivation": "The motivation for this study is to explore the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperatures, as it has significant implications for the order of the chiral phase transition and the QCD phase diagram. It is important because the restoration of $U(1)_A$ symmetry can influence the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe or in high-energy collisions.", "method": "The authors propose a novel approach to probe the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry by analyzing the degeneracy of pseudoscalar and flavour non-singlet scalar correlators using hadron correlation functions. This analysis is performed on anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles, which are lattice QCD configurations with a specific temporal and spatial lattice spacing ratio, providing better resolution for time-like separations.", "result": "The result of the study indicates that the $U(1)_A$ symmetry is effectively restored at a temperature of about 320 MeV, which is notably higher than the chiral transition temperature of 180 MeV. This finding suggests a separation between the chiral and $U(1)_A$ restoration scales, which could have consequences for the understanding of the QCD phase diagram and the nature of the chiral transition.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from this work is that the $U(1)_A$ symmetry restoration occurs at a higher temperature than the chiral transition, implying that these two phenomena may be distinct in the QCD phase diagram. The use of anisotropic lattices and the latest Generation 3 ensembles provides a more accurate determination of the restoration temperature, contributing to a deeper understanding of the QCD phase structure."}}
