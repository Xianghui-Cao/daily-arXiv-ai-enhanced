Oare"], "title": "Moment problems and bounds for matrix-valued smeared spectral functions", "comment": "17 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Numerical analytic continuation arises frequently in lattice field theory,\nparticularly in spectroscopy problems. This work shows the equivalence of\ncommon spectroscopic problems to certain classes of moment problems that have\nbeen studied thoroughly in the mathematical literature. Mathematical results\ndue to Kovalishina enable rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral\nfunctions, which are implemented numerically for the first time. The required\ninput is a positive-definite matrix of Euclidean-time correlation functions;\nsuch matrices are routinely computed in variational spectrum studies using\nlattice quantum chromodynamics. This work connects the moment-problem\nperspective to recent developments using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and Lanczos\nalgorithm. Possible limitations due to finite numerical precision are\ndiscussed."}

The\nshort-range matrix elements associated with the $\\pi^- \\to \\pi^+ ee$ process\ncontribute at leading order in the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay channel $nn \\to ppee$\nthrough pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations\nshow notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To\naddress this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $\\pi^- \\to\n\\pi^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical\npion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate\ncontamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to\nreconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a\nnonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with\nprevious studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements\nand provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the\ndiscrepancies among previous lattice calculations."}

Cruz", "Masafumi Udagawa", "Pedro Bicudo", "Pedro Ribeiro", "Paul A. McClarty"], "title": "Hollow Lattice Tensor Gauge Theories with Bosonic Matter", "comment": null, "summary": "Higher rank gauge theories are generalizations of electromagnetism where, in\naddition to overall charge conservation, there is also conservation of higher\nrank multipoles such as the total dipole moment. In this work we study a four\ndimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has\nsecond rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on\nindividual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action\nfor the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action\nformulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a\nfunction of the gauge ($\\beta$) and matter ($\\kappa$) couplings. We compute the\nnature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and\ncompare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive\nweak coupling regime (small $\\kappa$, large $\\beta$) does not survive in the\nthermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the\nwhole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak\ncoupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected\nstrong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For\nfinite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit\nwith a first order phase transition terminating in a critical endpoint.For\n$q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic\ntopological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed\nreveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case."}
