In particular, we aim to identify a critical region\nexpected to exist along a $\\theta=\\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure\nnon-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor\nrenormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous\ntensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial\ntensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves\nhigher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement\nconsists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the\nconformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions,\nwhich can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group\nmethod. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the\ncritical region, $\\beta_{\\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the\nSU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the phase structure of a 2D lattice CP(1) model with a \u03b8 term, particularly along the \u03b8=\u03c0 line. It uses an improved tensor renormalization group method to avoid the sign problem and to identify the critical region and its universality class, which is found to be the SU(2)\u2096\u208c\u2081 Wess-Zumino-Witten model.", "motivation": "The motivation is to non-perturbatively explore the phase structure of a 2D lattice CP(1) model with a \u03b8 term, especially around the \u03b8=\u03c0 line, where a critical region is expected. The authors aim to overcome the sign problem that typically complicates such studies and to determine the characteristics of the critical region, including the onset and the universality class.", "method": "The method involves the use of an enhanced tensor renormalization group (TRG) approach. Two key improvements are introduced: the refinement of the initial tensor through a quadrature method for better accuracy, and the analysis of the phase structure using conformal field theory data, specifically the central charge and scaling dimensions, which can be effectively obtained by TRG.", "result": "The results show the identification of the critical region's onset at \u03b2c=0.5952(8). Furthermore, it is determined that the universality class of the system corresponds to the SU(2)\u2096\u208c\u2081 Wess-Zumino-Witten model.", "conclusion": "The study successfully identifies the critical region and its universality class in the 2D lattice CP(1) model with a \u03b8 term. The findings support the theoretical expectations and provide a more accurate understanding of the phase structure, thanks to the improvements in the tensor renormalization group method."}}

A new estimate for the mass-dependent\nimprovement coefficient $\\bar{b}_{\\mathrm{A}}^\\mathrm{eff}$ has recently become\navailable, differing from the one used in our earlier study, and on which our\nimplementation via a massive axial Ward identity relied. Here, we update our\nanalysis of the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients based on the\nnew axial current improvement coefficient, and analyse additional ensembles\nwith a different chiral trajectory in order to validate our results at two\nvalues of the bare coupling.

They also analyze additional ensembles with a different chiral trajectory to validate their findings at two values of the bare coupling.", "result": "The results show that the use of the new estimate for bar{b}_{mathrm{A}}^mathrm{eff} leads to improved consistency between the two chiral trajectories and with a previous determination of the improvement coefficients in the massless limit on smaller volumes. This suggests that the updated analysis provides a more reliable description of the O(a)-improvement for non-singlet vector currents.", "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper is that updating the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients with the new estimate of the mass-dependent axial current improvement coefficient enhances the consistency and reliability of the O(a)-improvement framework for non-singlet vector currents. This update is important for achieving more precise lattice QCD calculations."}}
