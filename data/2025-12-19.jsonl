Kiel"], "title": "Critical coupling in $φ_2^4$ theory", "comment": "13 pages, 6 tables, 6 figures", "summary": "We consider $φ^4$ theory with $φ(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\\hatλ$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\\hatμ_{0\\mathrm{c}}^2(\\hatλ)$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\\hatμ_\\mathrm{c}^2(\\hatλ)$ is made. Finally, $f_\\mathrm{c}=\\lim_{\\hatλ\\to0}\\hatλ/\\hatμ_\\mathrm{c}^2(\\hatλ)$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\\mathrm{stat}(09)_\\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\\mathrm{tot}$."}

Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework."}
