This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $\u03b2$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\\langle L \\rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $\u03c3^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $\u03c7^2 \\approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
