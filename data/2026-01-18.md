### [1] [Minimally Truncated SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory and String Tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10065)
*Vincent Chen,Berndt Müller,Xiaojun Yao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices, focusing on a minimal electric field truncation. It provides the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for specific lattice structures and extends to general SU(Nc) gauge theory. The study includes exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, computation of the SU(3) string tension, and potential energies of static quark configurations at finite temperature.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of SU(3) gauge theory in a simplified setting, using a minimal truncation scheme, which allows for an analysis of the energy spectrum, string tension, and quark potential energies, including their thermal properties.

Method: The method involves formulating the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the honeycomb lattice, considering only specific representations for link variables. The researchers then use exact diagonalization to find the energy spectrum and analyze its statistical properties, as well as calculating the SU(3) string tension and the potential energies of quark-antiquark pairs and three-quark systems.

Result: Results include the energy spectrum of the gauge field, the calculation of the SU(3) string tension with modifications due to vacuum fluctuations, and the potential energies of static quark-antiquark and three-quark systems, along with their screening behaviors at finite temperatures.

Conclusion: The research concludes with a detailed understanding of the SU(3) gauge theory's behavior under minimal truncation, providing insights into the energy spectrum, string tension, and quark potential energies, while also discussing the effects of finite temperature on these properties.

Abstract: We study SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices in the minimal (qutrit) electric field truncation retaining only the ${\bf 1}, {\bf 3}, {\bf \overline{3}}$ representations for the link variables. Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.

### [2] [Diquark mass and quark-diquark potential by lattice QCD using an extended HAL QCD method with a static quark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10091)
*Kai-Wen Kelvin-Lee,Noriyoshi Ishii*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper calculates the diquark mass and quark-diquark potential using an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system. It uses 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations, HYP smearing, and two-point correlators to improve statistical noise and obtain ground-state energies. The scalar diquark mass is found to be approximately (2/3) of the nucleon mass, with a Cornell-type quark-diquark potential.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to calculate the diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential in a baryonic system, which can provide insight into the structure and behavior of baryons, specifically through the application of the extended HAL QCD method.

Method: The authors use 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations on a lattice, apply HYP smearing to reduce statistical noise, and compute two-point correlators for various types of diquarks to extract their ground-state energies. They then employ an extended HAL QCD method to determine the scalar diquark mass and quark-diquark potential self-consistently by matching the p-wave sector spectrum from the two-point correlators with the s-wave sector potential.

Result: The result of the paper is that the scalar diquark mass is determined to be about (2/3) of the nucleon mass, and the quark-diquark potential is of the Cornell type, consisting of a Coulombic and a linear term.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the extended HAL QCD method successfully provides a consistent calculation of the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential, which supports the understanding of the internal structure of baryons with a Cornell-type potential being a good description of the interaction between the quark and the diquark.

Abstract: We will calculate the diquark mass together with the quark-diquark potential. We apply an extended HAL QCD potential method to a baryonic system made up from a static quark and a diquark. Numerical calculations are performed by employing 2+1 flavor QCD gaugeconfigurations generated by CP-PACS and JLQCD Collaborations on a $16^{3} \times 32$ lattice with $a^{-1} \approx 1.6$ GeV. To improve the statistical noise in the propagators of the static quark, the HYP smearing is employed on the gauge links. Two-point correlators of quark-diquark baryonic system are then computed to obtain their ground-state energies where various types of diquarks are considered (eg: scalar diquark, axial-vector diquark etc). We apply an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system made up from a scalar diquark and a static quark to study the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential. In order to determine the diquark mass self-consistently in this HALQCD method, we demand that the baryonic spectrum in the p-wave sector obtained from the two-point correlators should be reproduced by the potential obtained from the baryonic system in the s-wave sector. We obtain the scalar diquark mass of roughly $(2/3) m_{N}$ , i.e., twice the naïve estimates of a constituent quark mass together with the quark-diquark potential of Cornell type (Coulomb + linear).
