We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\\sqrtσ/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $σ$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball."}

We demonstrate that the use of deep generative models drastically outperforms standard Monte Carlo algorithms. Remarkably, such a machine-learning method enables high-precision estimates of Rényi entropies in three dimensions for very large lattices. Moreover, we propose a new paradigm for studying lattice defects with flow-based sampling."}

Compared to the standard $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory."}

Proceedings of the 42nd International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2025), TIFR Mumbai, India, 2025", "summary": "Drawing upon well established zero-temperature techniques, we present, for the first time in a lattice calculation, insight into the fate of the $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium state at finite temperature. Specifically, using anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles we employ distillation with a wide operator basis which has been extensively used at zero-temperature by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration to study the charmonium spectrum. The constant contribution to some finite-temperature temporal correlation functions requires particular care with the extended operator basis common to distillation setups and we discuss this effect. As an alternative to derivative based extended operators, we also consider the use of optimal distillation profiles at finite temperature for the first time. Finally, we remark on the temperature dependence of the $1^{-+}$ spectral function by consideration of the reconstructed correlator method."}

Here, we present the infinite-dimensional matrix representation for arbitrary gauge-invariant operators at a trivalent vertex, which results in a standalone framework for computations that supersedes the underlying Schwinger-boson framework. To that end, we evaluate in closed form the result of applying any gauge-invariant operators on the LSH basis states introduced in Part I. Classical calculations in the LSH basis run significantly faster than equivalent calculations performed using Schwinger bosons. A companion code script is provided, which implements the derived formulas and aims to facilitate rapid progress towards Hamiltonian-based calculations of quantum chromodynamics."}
