Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation --\nwhere the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the\nelectric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors\nof fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to\nmeson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling,\nthe $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely\nresembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$\nsector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become\nentangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the\nslower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates\nballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables,\nentanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how\ncorrelations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a\nfirst benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and\nopen the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and\ninelastic processes in gauge theories."}

This\nstep is the main bottleneck for systematic studies of leading logarithmic\ncorrections to integer-power lattice artifacts in Symanzik Effective Field\nTheory targeting various local fields and lattice actions. The focus on\ndiscrete symmetry transformations in lattice field theory, especially reduced\nhypercubic spacetime symmetry with Euclidean signature, complicates the use of\nstandard continuum field theory tools.\n  Here, a new Python package is being presented that targets the typical\nlattice field-theorist's use cases. While the main target lies on continuum\nEFTs describing 4D non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, the applicability can be\nextended beyond Effective Field Theories. New discrete symmetries, twisted\nmasses, or the introduction of boosts are just a few examples of possible\nextensions that can be easily implemented by the user. This should allow for a\nwider range of theories and applications beyond the initial focus of this\npackage.\n  The general functionality of the package is explained along the lines of\nthree examples: The $\\mathrm{O}(a)$ operator basis of the axial-vector in\nWilson QCD, operator bases compatible with the symmetries of unrooted Staggered\nquarks as well as a pedestrian derivation of a\n$B^*(\\mathbf{p})\\pi(-\\mathbf{p})$ operator with pseudo-scalar quantum numbers.\nEach example makes use of an increasing range of features and requires\nuser-defined extensions show-casing the versatility of the package."}

The low energy\nconstants (LECs) of this EFT are obtained from lattice measurements of the\nscreening mass of pions at two temperatures for $N_f=2+1$ using lattice results\nobtained at physical values of pion and Kaon masses, and $N_f=2$ where the\nlattice simulations were performed with a heavier pion mass. The EFT gives good\npredictions for other static pion properties for $N_f=2$, where lattice results\nare available. We show the corresponding predictions for $N_f=2+1$, where they\nare not yet measured. We demonstrate that EFT gives excellent predictions for\nthe phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$. The predictions for the pressure are\ninvestigated, and predictions are also given for a Wick-rotated real-time\nquantity called the kinetic mass."}
