Concretely, we explore two different order\nparameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i)\nthe Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and\nconfinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator\nproposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases."}
