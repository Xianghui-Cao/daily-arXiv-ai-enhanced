Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators strongly
coupled to QCD two-particle states is developed, which is achieved by
incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions. To efficiently implement
these operators in lattice QCD, a novel quark smearing technique utilizing
noise vectors is proposed. Applied to the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system,
the optimized operators resolve distinct eigenstates separated by only $\sim 5$
MeV near the threshold $2m_{\Omega_{ccc}} \simeq 9700$ MeV. This exceptional
resolving power opens new possibilities for studies of a wide range of hadronic
systems in QCD.

### [2] [Wavefunction-based operator optimization for two-hadron systems in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09933)
*Yan Lyu,Sinya Aoki,Takumi Doi,Tetsuo Hatsuda,Kotaro Murakami,Takuya Sugiura*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new method for creating optimized interpolating operators for two-hadron systems is introduced, using inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions and a novel quark smearing technique. The method is applied to the ΩcccΩccc system, showing clear identification of states with a narrow energy gap. The study also compares unoptimized and optimized operators, discussing their effects on correlation functions, effective energies, and HAL QCD potentials, and explores the potential use of the optimized operator in various two-hadron systems and its connection to the variational method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a systematic approach for constructing optimized interpolating operators for two-hadron systems that can effectively incorporate inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions, leading to improved precision in identifying energy states and understanding the dynamics of such systems, without the need for computationally expensive all-to-all quark propagators.

Method: The method involves the development of a new quark smearing technique that uses Z3 noise vectors to incorporate inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions at the source level. This technique is then applied to the ΩcccΩccc system using physical-point lattice configurations. A comparison between unoptimized and optimized operators is conducted, with an analysis of correlation functions, effective energies, and HAL QCD potentials.

Result: The results show that the optimized operators enable the clear identification of states around 2mΩccc ≈ 9700 MeV with a very narrow energy gap of about 5 MeV. There is a notable difference in the behavior of correlation functions and effective energies when comparing unoptimized and optimized operators, which is attributed to the effect of nearby elastic scattering states. The optimized operators demonstrate better performance in resolving closely spaced energy levels.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method of constructing optimized interpolating operators, which incorporates inter-hadron wavefunctions, is effective in enhancing the resolution of energy states in two-hadron systems. The optimized operators are shown to be more sensitive to the presence of nearby states, and the method has the potential to be widely applicable to other two-hadron systems, including those where the variational method may not be as effective.

Abstract: A systematic way to constructing optimized interpolating operators for
two-hadron systems is developed by incorporating inter-hadron spatial
wavefunctions. The wavefunctions can be obtained from an iterative process with
an appropriate initial guess. To implement these operators, a novel quark
smearing technique utilizing $Z_3$ noise vectors is proposed, which allows for
effectively incorporating inter-hadron spatial wavefunctions at the source
without using all-to-all quark propagators. Proof-of-principle application to
the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ system using physical-point lattice
configurations with a large size $La\simeq8.1$~fm shows that optimized
operators enables clear identification of states around
$2m_{\Omega_{ccc}}\simeq 9700$ MeV with the energy gap as narrow as $\sim 5$
MeV. A comparison on correlation functions, effective energies, and HAL QCD
potentials between unoptimized operators and optimized operators is given, with
a special emphasis on the effects from nearby elastic scattering states.
Potential applicability of the optimized operator to various two-hadron systems
and its relation to the variational method are also discussed.

### [3] [Study of the $Λ\to p \ell \barν_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970)
*Simone Bacchio,Andreas Konstantinou*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents the first lattice QCD determination of the Λ to N vector and axial-vector form factors, which are important for studying the semileptonic decay Λ to p ℓ ν̄_ℓ. It provides a precise measurement of these form factors and related observables, revealing that neglecting the q^2-dependence of the form factors can lead to significant deviations in the decay rate, highlighting the need for accurate non-perturbative inputs for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide essential inputs for the study of the semileptonic decay Λ to p ℓ ν̄_ℓ, which is a clean and theoretically well-controlled process for extracting the CKM matrix element |V_us| from baryon decays. The aim is also to achieve sub-percent precision in the predictions, which is critical for upcoming experimental programs.

Method: The method involves using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with a gauge ensemble that includes physical light, strange, and charm quark masses. The analysis yields a full set of transition form factors, including second-class contributions, and related observables such as couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates.

Result: The results include the most precise determination to date of the Λ to N vector and axial-vector form factors, as well as an observation that neglecting the q^2-dependence of the form factors can cause a 4% deviation in the decay rate. This demonstrates the importance of having accurate, fully non-perturbative form factor data for high-precision physics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the precise, non-perturbative form factor calculations are crucial for achieving the high-precision targets of current and future experimental programs, as they reveal that approximations, such as neglecting the q^2-dependence, can result in noticeable errors in the predicted decay rates.

Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector
and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the
semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a
clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element
$|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with
physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise
determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including
second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and
the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible
non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative
results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter
$\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common
phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form
factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the
critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for
achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.

### [4] [Color-magnetic correlations in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10089)
*Atsuya Tokutake,Kei Tohme,Hideo Suganuma*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper studies the two-point field-strength correlation and gluon propagator in SU(2) and SU(3) quenched lattice QCD, finding that the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation is always negative, while the parallel-type is positive. In the infrared region, these correlations strongly cancel each other out, leading to a significant cancellation in the sum of the field-strength correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study was to investigate color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum, specifically by examining the perpendicular and parallel-type color-magnetic correlations within the framework of the Landau gauge in both SU(2) and SU(3) QCD.

Method: The authors used quenched lattice QCD simulations to study the two-point field-strength correlation and the gluon propagator. They also decomposed the field-strength correlation into quadratic, cubic, and quartic terms of the gluon field.

Result: It was found that the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation is always negative except at the same point, while the parallel-type is always positive. A strong cancellation between the two types of correlations occurs in the infrared region, leading to an almost zero net sum of the field-strength correlations.

Conclusion: The results suggest that there are significant cancellations between different components of the color-magnetic correlations in the QCD vacuum, which has implications for the understanding of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD.

Abstract: We study the two-point field-strength correlation $g^2 \langle
G_{\mu\nu}^a(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s') \rangle$ in the Landau gauge in SU(2) and
SU(3) quenched lattice QCD, as well as the gluon propagator $g^2 \langle
A_\mu^a (s)A_\nu^b(s') \rangle$. The Landau-gauge gluon propagator $g^2 \langle
A_\mu^a (s)A_\mu^a(s') \rangle$ is well described by the Yukawa-type function
$e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ for $r=0.1-1.0~{\rm fm}$ in both SU(2) and
SU(3) QCD. Next, motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum,
we investigate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r)
\equiv g^2\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \perp)) \rangle$ ($\hat \perp$: unit
vector on the $xy$-plane), and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv
g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \parallel) \rangle$ ($\hat \parallel$:
unit vector on the $tz$-plane). These two quantities reproduce all the
correlation of $g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$, due to
the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries in the Landau gauge.
Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is
found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point
correlation. In contrast, the parallel-type color-magnetic correlation
$C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region of $r \gtrsim
0.4~{\rm fm}$, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each
other, which leads to a significant cancellation in the sum of the
field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} g^2\langle
G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+
C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Finally, we decompose the field-strength
correlation into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$
in the Landau gauge.
