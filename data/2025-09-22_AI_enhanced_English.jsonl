We present a unified neural-network\napproach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements\ncalculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the\nlattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to\nphysical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms.\nUtilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases\nthat can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled\nmock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for\ndetermining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to\nzero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon\ntomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide\nan adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic\ndistributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization,\nadditional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and\nfuture facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.", "AI": {"tldr": "A unified neural-network approach is developed to learn parton distributions directly from lattice QCD simulations, integrating both momentum-space and coordinate-space data for improved accuracy and adaptability. This method enhances the extraction of physical quantities, enables nucleon tomography, and can be further refined with additional experimental data.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this paper is to improve the understanding and extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) inside hadrons, which are fundamental to visible matter. The authors aim to create a more accurate and adaptable method by unifying different types of data from numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).", "method": "The method involves developing a neural network that can simultaneously fit two types of inputs: data matched to physical quantities through known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms. By using both types of data, the method aims to stabilize the extraction process and reduce biases. It is validated on mock data and then applied to actual lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract PDFs, as well as extended to zero-skewness generalized parton distributions for nucleon tomography.", "result": "The results show that the proposed neural network approach effectively extracts partonic distributions and provides a robust framework for determining physical quantities. The method also allows for nucleon tomography and is capable of being systematically improved with additional data, such as polarization and experimental constraints from facilities like the Electron-Ion Collider.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the unified neural-network approach offers an advanced and flexible method for extracting parton distributions from Euclidean correlators. It has the potential to enhance our understanding of the internal structure of hadrons and can be adapted to incorporate new data, making it a powerful tool for future research in particle physics."}}
