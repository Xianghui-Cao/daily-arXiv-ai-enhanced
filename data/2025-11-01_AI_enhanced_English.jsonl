This approach is efficient for nonlocal operators such as meson-meson\nand baryon-baryon operators. However, local multiquark operators with four or\nmore (anti)quarks are computationally expensive in this framework: the cost of\ncontractions scales with a high power of the number of Laplacian eigenvectors.\nWe present a position-space sampling method within distillation that reduces\nthis cost scaling by performing the momentum projection only over sparse grids\nrather than the full spatial lattice.
