*Christoph Lehner,Julian Parrino,Andreas Völklein*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new method for high-precision computation of long-distance QED corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization, crucial for improving the accuracy of muon g-2 calculations, is presented and demonstrated using lattice QCD+QED data.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of computing long-distance QED corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization in lattice QCD+QED, which currently limits the precision of the muon g-2 experimental results from Fermilab E989.

Method: The authors developed a method that reconstructs exclusive finite-volume state contributions to achieve high-precision results. They established relations between pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and applied this reconstruction method to lattice QCD+QED data at a specific lattice spacing and pion mass.

Result: The method successfully reconstructed the pion-photon contributions and provided a demonstration with lattice QCD+QED data, showing its potential for high-precision calculations of the long-distance QED corrections.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising approach to improve the precision of long-distance QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization, which is essential for enhancing the accuracy of the muon g-2 theoretical predictions.

Abstract: The long-distance contribution of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum
polarization is particularly challenging to compute in lattice QCD+QED.
Currently, it is one of the limiting factors towards matching the precision of
the recent result by the Fermilab E989 experiment for the muon g-2. In this
work, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this
contribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We
find relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and
demonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single
lattice spacing of $a^{-1} \approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\pi \approx 275$ MeV.

### [2] [Lattice evidence that scalar glueballs are small](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21821)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the first calculation of gravitational form factors (GFFs) for the scalar glueball using lattice field theory, suggesting a distinct gluonic structure and smaller size compared to other hadrons, which may aid in experimental searches for glueballs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide new insights into the structure of the scalar glueball by calculating its gravitational form factors (GFFs), which can help distinguish it from typical hadronic states and inform experimental searches.

Method: The method involves the use of lattice field theory within the context of Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing to calculate the GFFs of the scalar glueball.

Result: The result is the prediction of a mass radius of 0.263(31) fm for the scalar glueball, indicating that it is significantly smaller than other hadrons, and that it has a different gluonic structure as suggested by the comparison with other hadrons' GFFs.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that the scalar glueball's unique gluonic structure and smaller size, as evidenced by the GFFs, could serve as a distinguishing feature for future experimental efforts aimed at detecting glueballs.

Abstract: This work reports the first calculation of the gravitational form factors
(GFFs) of the scalar glueball, performed via lattice field theory in Yang-Mills
theory at a single lattice spacing. The glueball GFFs are compared with those
of other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing
strong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than
typical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting
previous suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than
other hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun
characteristic to target by experimental glueball searches.
