The extracted form factors encode information\nabout its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the\nmagnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks.\nOur results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a\ncompact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light\nantidiquark $[\\bar u \\bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge\nradius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined\ncharge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying\nthreshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge\nform factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single\nCLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of\napproximately $a \\approx0.064 \\ \\mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\\pi \\approx\n290 \\ \\mathrm{MeV}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors for the exotic tetraquark T_bb, providing evidence that it is a bound state with a compact heavy diquark and a light antidiquark.

The researchers extracted form factors that encode information about the internal structure of the T_bb tetraquark.", "result": "The results show that the T_bb tetraquark has a significantly smaller charge radius compared to the combined charge radii of B and B* mesons, suggesting it is a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark [bb] and a light antidiquark [\u02d9u \u02d9d]. The study also provides separate determinations of the magnetic dipole moments for the light and heavy quarks within the T_bb tetraquark, as well as the electric charge form factors for the B and B* mesons.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from this work is that the T_bb tetraquark is likely a bound state with a specific configuration of a compact heavy diquark and a light antidiquark, and it possesses a smaller charge radius than the sum of the B and B* meson charge radii. This finding supports the idea of T_bb being an exotic hadron with a unique internal structure."}}

High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \\approx\n2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \\approx \\{ 0.15, 0.12,\n0.09 \\}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_\\pi \\approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark\nflavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{W} = 3a^2$,\nfinding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix\nelements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a\n\\approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit.
