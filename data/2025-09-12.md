TL;DR: The paper uses tensor network methods to simulate the real-time string dynamics of a 2+1D SU(2) Yang--Mills Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with dynamical matter, revealing non-Abelian features such as baryon blockade and representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances, which can guide future quantum simulators for non-Abelian LGTs.

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories and more complex non-Abelian LGTs, particularly in the context of advancing quantum simulation experiments, in order to gain insights into quark confinement and hadronization.

Method: The method involves using tensor network methods to simulate the real-time string dynamics of a 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Yang--Mills LGT, including the study of phenomena like string breaking, meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, and non-Abelian fluctuations such as glueball loops and self-crossed strings.

Result: Results include the observation of string breaking through Casimir reduction at resonance, discovery of a baryon blockade mechanism that delays string breaking at finite baryon density, and the identification of representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances for higher-energy strings. Additionally, purely non-Abelian fluctuations driven by the magnetic term were observed, including glueball loops and self-crossed strings.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the dynamics of non-Abelian LGTs and highlight the importance of non-Abelian features in the context of string dynamics, which can serve as a guide for the development of upcoming quantum simulators for non-Abelian LGTs.

Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement
and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have
mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the
advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to
bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one
spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time
string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.
In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through
sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a
distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a
\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from
resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball
loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with
distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover
representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a
guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical precision extrapolation method for approximating high-precision ξ-gauge fixing in Lattice QCD, which is validated by reproducing ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for quark bilinear operators with a 0.2% level of accuracy up to ξ ∼ 1.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant challenges faced when trying to achieve high-precision ξ-gauge fixing on the lattice, which has limited the application of Lattice QCD to off-shell partons mainly within the Landau gauge. The authors are inspired by the observed universal power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on the gauge-fixing precision in the Landau gauge and seek to extend this to ξ-gauge.

Method: An empirical precision extrapolation method is proposed to approximate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing. This involves defining the bare gauge coupling and then determining the effective ξ. The method's validity is tested by comparing the calculated ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators against known values.

Result: The method successfully reproduces the ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators with an accuracy of 0.2%, up to ξ values around 1. This indicates that the proposed approach can effectively simulate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed empirical precision extrapolation method provides a viable way to approximate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing in Lattice QCD, thereby potentially extending its applicability to a broader range of gauges beyond the Landau gauge, as demonstrated by the accurate reproduction of the ξ-dependent renormalization constants.

Abstract: Lattice QCD provides a first-principles framework for solving Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). However, its application to off-shell partons has been
largely restricted to the Landau gauge, as achieving high-precision $\xi$-gauge
fixing on the lattice poses significant challenges. Motivated by a universal
power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing
precision in the Landau gauge, we propose an empirical precision extrapolation
method to approximate high-precision $\xi$-gauge fixing. By properly defining
the bare gauge coupling and then the effective $\xi$, we validate our
$\xi$-gauge fixing procedure by successfully reproducing the $\xi$-dependent
RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2\%
level, up to $\xi \sim 1$.
