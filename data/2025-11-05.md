### [1] [Neural Field Transformations for Hybrid Monte Carlo: Architectural Design and Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02018)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of neural field transformations with Hybrid Monte Carlo (NTHMC) to improve sampling efficiency in lattice gauge theory simulations, particularly focusing on the choice of neural architectures. It evaluates NTHMC's performance on a 2D U(1) gauge theory and identifies design principles that can reduce autocorrelation and enhance topological tunneling, with the potential for application in 4D SU(3) gauge theory.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of critical slowing down in lattice gauge theory simulations, where the efficiency of sampling through configuration space decreases as one approaches the continuum limit. The paper aims to explore how the integration of neural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can be optimized by choosing appropriate neural network architectures to mitigate this problem.

Method: The method involves evaluating the NTHMC approach on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, using controlled comparisons to assess the impact of different neural architectures on sampling efficiency. The study analyzes scalability and transferability to larger volumes and finer lattice spacings, and it identifies beneficial design features such as wider receptive fields and channel-dependent activations.

Result: The results show that well-designed neural architectures within the NTHMC framework can significantly reduce autocorrelation times and increase topological tunneling, which are key factors for efficient sampling. These improvements are observed while maintaining good scaling properties as the system size and lattice spacing change.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that specific neural architecture designs, when used in conjunction with NTHMC, can greatly enhance the sampling efficiency of lattice gauge theory simulations. The findings provide a set of guidelines for future work, including the potential extension of these methods to more complex, four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theories.

Abstract: Critical slowing down, where autocorrelation grows rapidly near the continuum
limit due to Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) moving through configuration space
inefficiently, still challenges lattice gauge theory simulations. Combining
neural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can reshape the energy landscape
and accelerate sampling, but the choice of neural architectures has yet to be
studied systematically. We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge
theory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller
lattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural
contributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation
and boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling. More
broadly, our study highlights emerging design guides, such as wider receptive
fields and channel-dependent activations, paving the way for systematic
extensions to four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory.

Abstract: We report a new high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge
$g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending" method which
provides a high-accuracy stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion
propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can
efficiently cancel the major excited state contamination, we can extract
high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 of
the $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which covers 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations
with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, and
includes three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most accurate
lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0258[79]_{\rm tot}(56)_{\rm stat}
(24)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (24)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm
QCD} = 1.107[47]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi
(18)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the
systematic uncertainty from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations,
excited state contamination and also renormalization.
