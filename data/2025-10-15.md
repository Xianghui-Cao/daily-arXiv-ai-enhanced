Motivation: The challenge of calculating inclusive processes involving many particles in lattice QCD, which is a Euclidean-space method not well-suited for real-time, multiparticle production, motivates the exploration of new methods such as Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation to improve accuracy and applicability.

Method: The authors extend the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation method proposed by Bergamaschi et al. by studying the propagation of statistical and systematic errors through the interpolation process, using a simplified example of a multiparticle spectral function.

Result: The study provides insights into how errors propagate through the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation process, potentially aiding in more accurate predictions of multiparticle production, especially in the context of inclusive heavy-particle decays.

Conclusion: The extension of the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation method to account for error propagation offers a promising approach to improving the accuracy of lattice QCD calculations for complex, multiparticle systems, including those relevant to heavy-particle decay processes.

Abstract: The calculation of inclusive processes that involve the production of many
particles is a challenge for lattice QCD, a Euclidean-space method that is far
removed from real-time, multiparticle production. A new approach to this
problem based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation has been proposed by Bergamaschi
et al. Here we extend their method by exploring the propagation of the
statistical and systematic errors that accompany a lattice QCD calculation
through this interpolation process. A simplified example of a multiparticle
spectral function is studied with a focus on the possible applications of these
methods to the calculation of inclusive heavy-particle decays.

### [2] [Finite-length flux tube in the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory on the dual lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12168)
*Yoshiaki Koma,Miho Koma*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a numerical method for solving field equations in the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory, which models QCD as a dual superconductor. The method is applied to a dual lattice, allowing the study of finite-length flux tubes and their interactions, revealing nonperturbative properties of QCD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a powerful numerical method for solving field equations in the DGL theory, which can describe the quark confinement mechanism through the dual Meissner effect. By formulating the DGL theory on a dual lattice, the researchers aim to systematically investigate systems with finite-length flux tubes, which are more realistic than infinitely long ones.

Method: The method involves formulating the DGL theory on a dual lattice, which is then used to numerically solve the field equations. This allows for the detailed investigation of finite-length flux-tube solutions, including terminal effects and the interaction between multiple flux tubes, providing new insights into the nonperturbative properties of QCD.

Result: The results include the detailed analysis of finite-length flux-tube solutions, showing significant terminal effects not present in infinitely long flux tubes. Additionally, the study of two- and multi-flux-tube systems reveals new aspects of flux-tube interactions, contributing to the understanding of nonperturbative QCD phenomena.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the dual lattice formulation of the DGL theory, combined with the numerical method, provides a valuable tool for investigating the nonperturbative properties of QCD, particularly in relation to the quark confinement mechanism and the behavior of finite-length flux tubes.

Abstract: The dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory is one of the nonperturbative effective
field theories of QCD. The DGL theory describes the QCD vacuum as a dual
superconductor and possesses electric flux-tube solutions via the dual Meissner
effect, which applies to the quark confinement mechanism. We demonstrate a
powerful numerical method for solving the field equations in the DGL theory
with U(1) dual gauge symmetry. An essential aspect of our method is to
formulate the DGL theory on the dual lattice, which enables us to investigate
any system composed of finite-length flux tubes in a systematic manner. Taking
full advantage of the dual lattice formulation, we investigate the
finite-length flux-tube solution corresponding to the quark-antiquark system in
detail, which exposes the significant terminal effects absent in the infinitely
long flux-tube solution. We also study the flux-tube interaction in the two-
and multi-flux-tube systems, providing new insights into the nonperturbative
properties of QCD.
