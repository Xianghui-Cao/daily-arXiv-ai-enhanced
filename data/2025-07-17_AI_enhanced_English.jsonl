It is shown that color electric/magnetic fields have\ntwo components: the first part is a gradient/curl component, respectively, and\nthe second part is a nonlinear component. It is shown that the color electric\nfield has a Y-like spatial distribution. Such a Y-like behavior arises because\nthe gradient component of the electric field is present. The nonlinear\ncomponent of the electric field is a curl one, and it appears because the\nvector potential sourced by a solenoidal current is present. The color magnetic\nfield is purely curl one, since its nonzero color components do not contain a\nnonlinear component; this results in the fact that its force lines lie on the\nsurface of a torus. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement\nwith the results obtained in lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics. To\ndiscuss such an agreement, we consider a procedure of nonperturbative\nquantization and discuss possible approximations ensuring such an agreement.\nAlso, we compare the energy profile obtained by us with that obtained in\nlattice calculations with a static potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the Yang-Mills-Proca theory, presenting solutions with regular, finite energy. It describes the color electric and magnetic fields as having gradient/curl and nonlinear components, with the electric field showing a Y-like spatial distribution and the magnetic field's force lines lying on a torus. The results align well with lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics, and the paper explores nonperturbative quantization and energy profiles.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore the structure of color electric and magnetic fields within the Yang-Mills-Proca theory framework, and to compare the theoretical findings with lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics.", "method": "The method involves deriving solutions for the color electric and magnetic fields from the Yang-Mills-Proca theory, analyzing their components, and comparing the results with those from lattice QCD simulations. The authors also consider nonperturbative quantization procedures and discuss approximations that could lead to agreement between the theoretical model and lattice data.", "result": "The results show that the color electric field has a Y-shaped spatial distribution due to its gradient component, while the color magnetic field forms closed loops on the surface of a torus. Theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with the lattice QCD calculations, including the energy profile comparison with a static potential.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the Yang-Mills-Proca theory can provide a good description of color electric and magnetic fields, which is consistent with the findings from lattice QCD. The agreement suggests that the approach taken in the paper may be a valid method for understanding these fields in a nonperturbative context."}}
