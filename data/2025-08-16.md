TL;DR: The study investigates the S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon using lattice QCD, revealing overall attraction in both spin-1 and spin-2 channels but no dibaryon bound state. The potentials are decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components, with the former showing a short-range attractive core and long-range tail, and the latter indicating short-range attraction or repulsion depending on the spin channel. Comparisons to other systems highlight the importance of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability.

Motivation: To understand the S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon, which could provide insights into the nature of strong force at work between these particles and the possible formation of exotic states such as dibaryons.

Method: The researchers used (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations with a physical pion mass on a defined lattice volume. They employed a relativistic heavy-quark action for the charm quark and utilized the time-dependent HAL QCD method to extract the N-$\Omega_{\\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 and spin-2 channels. The extracted potentials were further analyzed by decomposing them into spin-independent and spin-dependent parts.

Result: The analysis found overall attraction in both the spin-1 and spin-2 channels, with scattering parameters suggesting the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The spin-independent potential was characterized by a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential showed short-range attraction in the spin-1 channel and short-range repulsion in the spin-2 channel. Additional comparisons with other hadronic systems emphasized the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence for an attractive interaction between the nucleon and the triply charmed Omega baryon, but does not support the existence of a bound dibaryon state. The decomposition of the potential into spin-independent and -dependent parts reveals the structure of the interaction, with the spin-independent part being dominant. The results also suggest that heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability plays a significant role in these interactions.

Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply
charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD
with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume
$\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a
relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the
time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in
the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are
extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering
parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and
$r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the
$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} =
2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel,
indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are
further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The
spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range
attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent
potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2)
channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and
$N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided,
emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from
soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm
quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated
as well.
