However, it can\nconverge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus\nunderscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as\nmonitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable,\nbut they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability\ntest based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the\ngradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this\nestimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a\nphysically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the\nestimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use\none-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the\nestimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and\nincomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method\nis readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where\nscalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is\ntied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring\ncan also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our\nresults suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a\nhybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide\nrange of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite\ndensity.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new reliability test for the complex Langevin method (CLM) is proposed, based on configurational temperature.
