Motivation: To compute the $I=\frac{3}{2}$ $\pi K$ $s$-wave scattering phase shift using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with improved techniques, and to compare the calculated effective range expansion parameters with both theoretical predictions and experimental measurements.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations with $N_f=3$ flavors of Asqtad-improved staggered fermions, utilizing energy-eigenvalues from $\pi K$ systems in one center-of-mass frame and six moving frames. The phase shifts are obtained by L\"uscher's formula and its extensions. The calculations provide effective range expansion parameters such as scattering length, effective range, and shape parameter, which are compared with next-to-leading order predictions in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory.

Result: The calculated effective range expansion parameters (scattering length, effective range, and shape parameter) are in good agreement with analytical predictions in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. The results also show consistency with experimental measurements, phenomenological studies, and other lattice estimations.

Conclusion: The study successfully computes the $I=\frac{3}{2}$ $\pi K$ $s$-wave scattering phase shift using lattice QCD, providing reliable values for the effective range expansion parameters that match well with theoretical and experimental findings.

Abstract: The $I=\frac{3}{2}$ $πK$ $s$-wave scattering phase shift is computed by lattice quantum chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavors of Asqtad-improved staggered fermions. The energy-eigenvalues of $πK$ systems at one center of mass frame and six moving frames using moving wall source technique are used to get phase shifts by Lüscher's formula and its extensions. The calculations are good enough to acquire effective range expansion parameters: scattering length $a$, effective range $r$, and shape parameter $P$, which are in good agreement with our explicit analytical predictions in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. All results are fairly consistent with experimental measurements, phenomenological studies, and lattice estimations. Numerical computations are implemented at a fine ($a\approx0.082$ fm, $L^3 T = 40^3 96$) lattice ensemble with physical quark masses.
