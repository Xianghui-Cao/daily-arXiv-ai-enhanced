TL;DR: The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the two-photon-exchange amplitude in the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, revealing a destructive interference between long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and compute the contribution of the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude to the rare kaon decay $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$, which requires a detailed analysis of both long- and short-distance effects within the framework of lattice QCD and QED.

Method: The authors use a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble with a $24^3\times 64$ lattice and an inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV. They employ a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism and implement strategies for five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies, achieving 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the amplitude.

Result: The result shows that there is a destructive interference between the long- and short-distance contributions to the decay amplitude, with the precision being limited by the reconstruction of the $\eta$ intermediate state's physical contribution, for which different strategies were tested and compared.

Conclusion: The study provides a significant insight into the rare kaon decay process, offering a first-principles determination of the interference pattern between long- and short-distance amplitudes, although the precision is constrained by the challenge of accurately representing the $\eta$ meson's role.

Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which
contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice
QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an
inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism.
Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed
diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision
on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a
destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the
decay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The
precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical
contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are
tested and compared.
