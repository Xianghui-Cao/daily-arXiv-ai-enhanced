Inspired by a recent\ncombinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere\ntriangulations constructed from trees, called the \\emph{triple-tree} class, we\npresent a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning\ntrees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the\ntriangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be\nviewed as a bipartite graph, called the \\emph{middle graph} of the\ntriangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a\ntree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase\nstructure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph\ncomes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components\nand loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows\none to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted\ntree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of\na new phase, referred to as the \\emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar\ncrumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase\ntransitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to\ntriple-tree phase transition is continuous.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores an extended model of Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) in 3D, incorporating a pair of spanning trees and a middle graph. The study reveals a new phase, the triple-tree phase, alongside the known crumpled and branched polymer phases, with evidence suggesting a continuous transition between the branched polymer and triple-tree phases.", "motivation": "The motivation is to revisit and expand upon the Euclidean DT approach by examining a specific subclass of 3-sphere triangulations, inspired by recent combinatorial studies, in order to uncover new insights into the non-perturbative quantum gravity and the phase structure of DT models.", "method": "The method involves Monte Carlo simulations of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees and a middle graph, which can be either a tree or have multiple components and loops. By introducing coupling constants, the researchers are able to interpolate between the restricted triple-tree class and the unrestricted tree-decorated DT, allowing for the exploration of a broader range of configurations and phase transitions.", "result": "The result is the discovery of a new phase, the triple-tree phase, in addition to the well-known crumpled and branched polymer phases. The research also provides statistical analysis that suggests a continuous transition from the branched polymer to the triple-tree phase, as indicated by the behavior of the middle graph's invariants.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from this work is that by extending the DT model with a pair of spanning trees and considering the properties of the middle graph, it is possible to identify a new phase of the system, which enriches our understanding of the phase structure in 3D quantum gravity models and opens up new avenues for further investigation."}}

We\ncalculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string\nconfigurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances\ndetermined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various\nstring breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance\nstrings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields,\nwe fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in\nmaximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical\nregime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the\nlatter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD).
