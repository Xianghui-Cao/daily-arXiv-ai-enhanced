TL;DR: Researchers used lattice simulations and rational function approximations to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane, which allowed them to make an educated guess about the temperature of the critical endpoint. They concluded with 84% probability that the chiral critical endpoint is either below 103 MeV or does not exist, while also discussing the limitations and future work.

Motivation: The motivation was to use high-statistics lattice simulations to better understand the QCD free energy and its properties, specifically aiming to locate the Lee-Yang zeros and estimate the critical endpoint temperature where a phase transition occurs.

Method: The method involved performing high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions, calculating Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure, constructing rational function approximations for the free energy, and fitting the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros to models based on 3D Ising critical point behavior.

Result: The results indicated that, with 84% probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either at a temperature below 103 MeV or it does not exist. The study also highlighted some inherent caveats of the method that remain even with very high statistics.

Conclusion: The conclusion was that while the method provided an estimation of the critical endpoint, there are significant systematic errors and methodological caveats that need to be addressed. Future high-statistics lattice analyses may help in reducing these uncertainties.

Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved
staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor
expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical
potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary
chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function
approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly
satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity,
which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to
estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential
plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros
is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free
energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to
estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources
of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$
probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature
or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not
disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We
discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics
lattice analyses.
