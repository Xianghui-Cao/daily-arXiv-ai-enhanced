TL;DR: The paper describes a non-perturbative method for determining the QCD Equation of State up to electroweak scale temperatures, with a focus on constant physics lines and shifted boundary conditions that allow direct entropy density determination. The method yields results with 1% accuracy and is applicable to QCD with different quark flavors and other thermal observables.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a detailed account of the theoretical and computational progress enabling the non-perturbative determination of the QCD Equation of State (EoS) at very high temperatures, up to the electroweak scale, with controlled uncertainties.

Method: The method involves defining lines of constant physics using a non-perturbatively defined finite-volume coupling across various energy scales and employing shifted boundary conditions to directly determine the entropy density. The approach includes integrating in the bare coupling and quark mass, perturbative improvement of lattice observables, optimization of numerical simulations, and continuum extrapolation.

Result: The final results have a relative accuracy of about 1% or better, with errors primarily due to statistical fluctuations from Monte Carlo ensembles. The non-perturbative results are compared with standard and hard thermal loop perturbation theory, showing the importance of non-perturbative contributions even at the highest temperatures studied.

Conclusion: The methodological framework is robust and general, allowing for systematic non-perturbative studies of thermal QCD at very high temperatures, and it can be applied to QCD with four and five massive quark flavors as well as other thermal observables.

Abstract: We present a detailed account of the theoretical progress and the computational strategy that led to the non-perturbative determination of the QCD Equation of State (EoS) at temperatures up to the electroweak scale reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 201904 (2025)]. The two key ingredients that make such a calculation feasible with controlled uncertainties are: (i) the definition of lines of constant physics through the running of a non-perturbatively defined finite-volume coupling across a wide range of energy scales, and (ii) the use of shifted boundary conditions which allow a direct determination of the entropy density thus without the need for a zero-temperature subtraction. Considering the case of QCD with $N_f =3$ massless flavours in the temperature interval between 3 GeV and 165 GeV, we describe the numerical strategy based on integrating in the bare coupling and quark mass, the perturbative improvement of lattice observables, the optimization of numerical simulations, and the continuum extrapolation. Extensive consistency checks, including finite-volume and topological-freezing effects, confirm the robustness of the method. The final results have a relative accuracy of about $1\%$ or better, and the errors are dominated by the statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo ensembles. We also compare our non-perturbative results with predictions from standard and hard thermal loop perturbation theory showing that at the level of $\%$-precision contributions beyond those known, including non-perturbative ones due to ultrasoft modes, are relevant up to the highest temperatures explored. The methodological framework is general and readily applicable to QCD with four and five massive quark flavours and to other thermal observables, paving the way for systematic non-perturbative studies of thermal QCD at very high temperatures.
