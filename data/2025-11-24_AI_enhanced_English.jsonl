Meyer"], "title": "Euclidean coordinate-space perturbation theory with a single mass scale", "comment": "47 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We develop elements of coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in general $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper develops coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in d-dimensional Euclidean space and provides analytic expressions for three-point correlation functions, with applications in various calculations including lattice QCD.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a theoretical framework and analytical tools for the study of massive quantum field theories, particularly useful for complex perturbative calculations, finite temperature/volume effects, and lattice QCD treatments.", "method": "The method involves using Gegenbauer polynomial expansion and systematically studying antiderivatives of products of Bessel functions. The authors apply these methods to calculate one-loop propagators in both vacuum and at finite temperature.", "result": "The results include analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with mixed mass particles, as well as specific computations of one-loop propagators under different conditions.", "conclusion": "The developed framework and obtained results are expected to contribute to more accurate and efficient perturbative calculations in quantum field theories, especially in scenarios involving high-degree vertices and hadronic effects."}}

The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions.
