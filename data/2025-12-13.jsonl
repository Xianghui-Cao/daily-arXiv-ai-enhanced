Katz", "Daniel Nogradi"], "title": "QCD on the 16-cell honeycomb", "comment": "6 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "We formulate QCD discretized on the four dimensional 16-cell honeycomb. The advantage is a higher degree of rotational symmetry as compared to a traditional cubic lattice leading to much smaller cut-off effects. We demonstrate in quenched QCD, through both gluonic and fermionic observables, that the scaling properties are indeed superior to the cubic lattice and much larger lattice spacings are sufficient for controlled continuum extrapolations. Chiral and topological properties also show remarkable improvement."}

The method relies on a factorization of the quark propagator into domain-local contributions that depend only on the gauge fields within overlapping temporal regions, enabling independent submeasurements of each term through a two-level sampling strategy. The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling. The method is tested on pure gauge ensembles, providing a controlled benchmark for its forthcoming application to dynamical QCD studies of glueball and isosinglet meson correlation functions."}

Particular emphasis is given to the axes where direct simulations are possible and results are obtained with sufficient control over systematic effects. I also discuss the status of approaching the region of non-zero baryochemical potentials using indirect methods."}
