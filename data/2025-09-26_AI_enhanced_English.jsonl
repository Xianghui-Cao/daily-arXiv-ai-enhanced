Our method\nemploys an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit\nstructure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our\nsimulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification\nof phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors.\nClassical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters,\nwhich are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude\nby discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to\nlarger systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics simulation on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors, with a method that enforces Gauss's law. It benchmarks the protocol on a small lattice and uses classical simulations to optimize parameters for quantum hardware. The work concludes with a discussion on current hardware limitations and future scaling possibilities.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics at finite density using quantum computing, which can potentially solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, especially when simulating gauge theories with fermions.", "method": "The method used is an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz along with a quantum circuit structure designed to enforce Gauss's law. The researchers benchmark their approach on a small lattice system and use classical simulations to determine optimized variational parameters for the quantum computations.", "result": "The results show that the phase transitions can be identified by the particle number of the fermion flavors within the small lattice system. The optimized parameters from classical simulations were successfully used in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware.", "conclusion": "The conclusion discusses the current limitations of the quantum hardware and provides an outlook on the potential for scaling up the method to larger systems, indicating both the present achievements and future challenges."}}
