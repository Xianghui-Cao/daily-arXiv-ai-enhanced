Yaffe"], "title": "Resurrecting the coherent state variational algorithm for large $N$ gauge theories", "comment": "45 pages", "summary": "The feasibility of studying, numerically, properties of infinite volume QCD-like theories in the large $N$ limit using coherent state variational methods is reassessed. An entirely new implementation of this approach is described, applicable to SU($N$) lattice gauge theories, with or without fundamental representation fermions, on cubic lattices of up to four dimensions. In addition to various test cases, initial results are presented for Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory on an infinite two-dimensional spatial lattice."}

We report a direct Monte Carlo strategy to measure $Z_{\\mathrm{tH}}$ without reweighting, by extending hybrid Monte Carlo to include dynamical updates of the background flux variables. As a first application we measure all flux sectors of four-dimensional $SU(2)$ lattice Yang--Mills on $T^4$ and observe the characteristic ``light/heavy'' behavior expected in the confining phase, together with the shift implied by the Witten effect at $θ=2π$. We also present a preliminary finite-temperature study and discuss outstanding issues on thermalization and separability between different flux sectors."}

However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density."}

The chiral and nuclear transitions are investigated by calculating the chiral condensate and the quark number density as a function of the chemical potential. For a fixed temporal extent $N_τ=8$, we determine the critical quark masses $m_c^χ$ and $m_c^{n}$ for the chiral condensate and the quark number density, respectively, at which the first-order phase transition terminates with the vanishing discontinuity in thermodynamic quantities. We find that both quantities at the same quark mass exhibit a discontinuity at the same chemical potential, and the resulting critical quark masses are consistent with each other. We also compare our results for the critical quark masses with those obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation in the dual formulation and from the mean-field analysis. We further confirm the first-order phase transition at finite quark mass on a $1024^4$ lattice, which is essentially in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature, as expected from the mean-field analysis."}

A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility."}
