Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires \"moderate\" parameter tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper develops a Hamiltonian formulation for minimally doubled lattice fermions, classifies their symmetries, and explores the conditions under which single-Weyl nodes can be maintained. It also shows that additional Weyl nodes can appear with deformations, indicating the need for parameter tuning to maintain the single-node regime in interacting theories.", "motivation": "The motivation is to systematically formulate and classify minimally doubled lattice fermions, as well as to explore the stability of single-Weyl nodes against radiative corrections in interacting theories, which is important for understanding the behavior of fermions in lattice models.", "method": "The authors use a Hamiltonian approach to develop a theory for minimally doubled lattice fermions, derive their nodal structures, and classify their symmetries. They also introduce a deformation that preserves all symmetries and examine its effect on the emergence of additional Weyl nodes.", "result": "The results include a classification of symmetry patterns for both Dirac and Weyl fermions, an analysis of the non-onsite symmetry protecting the Weyl node, and the demonstration that additional Weyl nodes can emerge when a deformation parameter exceeds a critical value, suggesting the need for 'moderate' parameter tuning to keep the system within the single-node phase.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that maintaining the single-Weyl phase in the presence of interactions may require fine-tuning of parameters, as radiative corrections can lead to the appearance of additional Weyl nodes, which has implications for the robustness of Weyl semimetals and related topological phases in theoretical and experimental contexts."}}

Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_\u03c0L \\lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes the effect of a finite volume on pion-pion scattering using Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM), with a focus on both s-channel and t,u-channel contributions, providing a more accurate calculation for energy levels and phase-shifts in lattice data.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of pion-pion scattering within a finite volume, which includes not only the s-channel loops but also the t, u-channels and tadpole contributions, improving upon previous analyses that did not account for these additional factors. The goal is to better understand the volume dependence of two-pion scattering energy levels, which can help in the determination of energy levels and phase-shifts from lattice QCD simulations.", "method": "The method involves using Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) to calculate the finite volume effects on pion-pion scattering, taking into account discretization in s, t, and u-channels as well as tadpole terms. The researchers then extend the Veltman-Pasarino identities and project onto the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations of the octahedral group. Using this framework, they construct the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) to determine the interacting energy levels of two-pions in a finite volume.", "result": "The results show significant corrections to the energy levels when compared to earlier studies, particularly for m_\u03c0L values less than or around 2, and are consistent with the available lattice data. This suggests that the inclusion of the t, u-channels and tadpole contributions is necessary for an accurate description of the finite volume effects on pion-pion scattering.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the study is that the new approach, which accounts for a wider range of channels and contributions, leads to improved accuracy in the determination of energy levels and phase-shifts. The findings are expected to contribute to the optimization of methods for extracting physical observables from lattice QCD calculations."}}
