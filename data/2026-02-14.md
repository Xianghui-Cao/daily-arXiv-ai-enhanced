*Xiang Gao,Jinchen He,Joshua Lin,Swagato Mukherjee,Peter Petreczky,Rui Zhang,Yong Zhao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the Coulomb gauge method in lattice QCD to calculate nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs) without Wilson lines, showing promising results for valence-quark PDFs and identifying challenges with full-quark-channel PDFs due to excited-state contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations for parton distributions by using a novel approach that avoids the need for Wilson lines, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET).

Method: The method involves implementing the Coulomb gauge approach on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with specific parameters, including lattice spacing, volume, and pion mass, and using boosted nucleon states to compute unpolarized, helicity, and transversity PDFs from the real and imaginary parts of correlators.

Result: Results show good convergence and compatibility with global analyses for valence-quark PDFs, while discrepancies are found in full-quark-channel PDFs, likely due to excited-state contamination, especially at lower nucleon momenta.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the Coulomb gauge approach is effective for calculating nucleon PDFs, particularly for valence-quark structures, and serves as a foundation for its further application, despite challenges identified in the full-quark-channel PDFs.

Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers used a spectroscopy scheme and the tensor renormalization group method to investigate multi-particle states in the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, identifying one-, two-, and three-particle states and calculating the two-particle scattering phase shift, which they compared with exact predictions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore and understand the multi-particle states within the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, by employing an innovative combination of spectroscopy and tensor network methods, which allows for the identification of particle states and their interactions.

Method: The method involves computing the finite-volume energy spectrum using the transfer matrix, which is estimated numerically with a coarse-grained tensor network. The quantum numbers and momenta of eigenstates are identified through system symmetries and interpolating operator matrix elements. Energy levels are plotted against system size to determine the number of particles in each state, and the two-particle scattering phase shift is calculated using Lüscher's formula and wave function approaches.

Result: The result is the successful identification of one-, two-, and three-particle states within the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model. Additionally, the researchers were able to compute the two-particle scattering phase shift and compare it with the exact theoretical prediction, providing a validation of their numerical approach.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this research is that the spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method is effective in analyzing multi-particle states in the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, and the computed two-particle scattering phase shift agrees well with the exact solution, indicating the reliability of the proposed method.

Abstract: We investigate the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model using a spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method. We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using Lüscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction.
