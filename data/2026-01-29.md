### [2] [Direct numerical simulation of the 't Hooft partition function and (de)confining phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20159)
*Okuto Morikawa,Hiroshi Suzuki*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new Monte Carlo method is introduced to directly measure the 't Hooft partition function, which encodes information on different phases in Yang-Mills theories. The method is applied to 4D $SU(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills, observing expected behavior in the confining phase and the Witten effect. A preliminary finite-temperature study is also discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a direct method for measuring the 't Hooft partition function, which is significant for understanding various phases in Yang-Mills theories, including confinement, without resorting to reweighting techniques that can introduce systematic errors.

Method: The authors extend the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm to include dynamical updates of background flux variables, allowing for the direct measurement of the 't Hooft partition function across all flux sectors. This method is then applied to four-dimensional $SU(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory on a $T^4$ manifold.

Result: The results show the expected 'light/heavy' behavior in the confining phase of the $SU(2)$ gauge theory, and the team also observes the shift due to the Witten effect at $θ=2π$. Additionally, a preliminary finite-temperature study is presented, although with outstanding issues regarding thermalization and separability between different flux sectors.

Conclusion: The new method provides a promising approach to directly measure the 't Hooft partition function, which could lead to a better understanding of the phases in Yang-Mills theories. However, further work is needed to address the challenges in thermalization and the separability of flux sectors, especially in the context of finite-temperature studies.

Abstract: The 't Hooft partition function $Z_{\mathrm{tH}}[E_i;B_{ij}]$ is a discrete Fourier transform of Yang--Mills partition functions in background $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form gauge fields and encodes information on confinement, Higgs, Coulomb and oblique-confining phases. We report a direct Monte Carlo strategy to measure $Z_{\mathrm{tH}}$ without reweighting, by extending hybrid Monte Carlo to include dynamical updates of the background flux variables. As a first application we measure all flux sectors of four-dimensional $SU(2)$ lattice Yang--Mills on $T^4$ and observe the characteristic ``light/heavy'' behavior expected in the confining phase, together with the shift implied by the Witten effect at $θ=2π$. We also present a preliminary finite-temperature study and discuss outstanding issues on thermalization and separability between different flux sectors.

### [3] [Thermodynamic Consistency as a Reliability Test for Complex Langevin Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20527)
*Anosh Joseph,Arpith Kumar*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new method based on configurational temperature is proposed to improve the reliability of the complex Langevin method (CLM) in quantum field theories, which can directly check thermodynamic consistency and detect various types of errors or artifacts. This approach, tested on one-dimensional models, shows promise for application in more complex systems like lattice QCD at finite density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions using the complex Langevin method (CLM), while overcoming the issue of CLM potentially converging to incorrect results. The need for a more direct and physically interpretable diagnostic tool to ensure the correctness of CLM simulations is highlighted.

Method: The researchers introduce a new test based on the configurational temperature, which is derived from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. This estimator is designed to probe thermodynamic consistency and to identify algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. The method is applied to one-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a proof of concept.

Result: The configurational temperature method accurately reproduces the input temperature and is sensitive to detecting different kinds of errors and artifacts in the CLM. It provides a robust and physically meaningful cross-check that can be extended to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, including lattice QCD at finite density.

Conclusion: The configurational temperature serves as an effective and reliable diagnostic tool for the complex Langevin method, enhancing its applicability across a wide range of theoretical models, including those with significant practical relevance such as lattice QCD at finite density.

Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising tool to address the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, highlighting the need for robust diagnostics. Existing checks, such as monitoring drift distributions, are useful but indirect. We propose a complementary test based on the configurational temperature, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based criteria, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and provides a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. Using one-dimensional PT-symmetric models, we show that it reproduces the input temperature with high precision and sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While demonstrated in simple systems, the method extends naturally to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also provide an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results indicate that configurational temperature can enhance CLM reliability across a broad range of applications, including lattice QCD at finite density.

### [4] [Tensor renormalization group study of cold and dense QCD in the strong coupling limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20690)
*Yuto Sugimoto,Shinichiro Akiyama,Yoshinobu Kuramashi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional cold and dense QCD with Kogut-Susskind quarks in the strong coupling limit, using the tensor renormalization group method. It finds that the chiral and nuclear transitions occur at the same chemical potential for a given quark mass, and the critical quark masses where first-order phase transitions terminate are consistent. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field analysis, and a first-order phase transition is confirmed on a large lattice, indicative of the thermodynamic limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phase structure of QCD at high density and low temperature, specifically looking at the chiral and nuclear transitions, and to determine the critical quark masses where the first-order phase transitions end.

Method: The authors use the tensor renormalization group method to study the system in the strong coupling limit. They calculate the chiral condensate and quark number density as functions of the chemical potential, and they compare their findings with Monte Carlo simulation results and mean-field predictions.

Result: The results show that the chiral and nuclear transitions occur at the same chemical potential for a given quark mass, and the critical quark masses for both quantities are consistent. Additionally, a first-order phase transition is observed on a very large lattice, which approaches the thermodynamic limit, corroborating the mean-field analysis.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the tensor renormalization group method provides a consistent determination of the critical quark masses for the termination of first-order phase transitions in (3+1)-dimensional cold and dense QCD. The findings are in agreement with other methods, and the behavior of the system is consistent with expectations from the mean-field theory.

Abstract: We study the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional cold and dense QCD with the Kogut--Susskind quark in the strong coupling limit using the tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and nuclear transitions are investigated by calculating the chiral condensate and the quark number density as a function of the chemical potential. For a fixed temporal extent $N_τ=8$, we determine the critical quark masses $m_c^χ$ and $m_c^{n}$ for the chiral condensate and the quark number density, respectively, at which the first-order phase transition terminates with the vanishing discontinuity in thermodynamic quantities. We find that both quantities at the same quark mass exhibit a discontinuity at the same chemical potential, and the resulting critical quark masses are consistent with each other. We also compare our results for the critical quark masses with those obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation in the dual formulation and from the mean-field analysis. We further confirm the first-order phase transition at finite quark mass on a $1024^4$ lattice, which is essentially in the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature, as expected from the mean-field analysis.

### [5] [A scalable flow-based approach to mitigate topological freezing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20708)
*Claudio Bonanno,Andrea Bulgarelli,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada,Dario Panfalone,Davide Vadacchino,Lorenzo Verzichelli*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) to address topological freezing in lattice gauge theories, specifically 4d SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. The SNF approach aims to eliminate unphysical boundary artifacts introduced by Open Boundary Conditions (OBC) and is shown to outperform purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods while reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the issue of topological freezing that occurs in standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations when lattice gauge theories are close to the continuum limit. While Open Boundary Conditions (OBC) can alleviate this, they introduce unwanted side effects such as breaking translation invariance and unphysical boundary artifacts. The authors aim to develop a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove these artifacts.

Method: The method involves the use of Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), which combine non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers through masked parametric stout smearing. The SNFs are trained by minimizing the average dissipated work, which is equivalent to reducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, leading to more reversible trajectories and enhanced efficiency.

Result: The results show that the defect SNFs scale well with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the OBC defect and perform better than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at a similar computational cost. The proposed method is validated by successfully reproducing established results for the topological susceptibility in 4d SU(3) Yang-Mills theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) method provides an effective and efficient solution to the problem of topological freezing and boundary artifacts in lattice gauge theories. It offers a promising alternative to traditional MCMC and OBC approaches, particularly for large-scale simulations where ergodicity and physical accuracy are crucial.

Abstract: As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.
