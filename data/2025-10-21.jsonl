The extracted form factors encode information\nabout its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the\nmagnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks.\nOur results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a\ncompact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light\nantidiquark $[\\bar u \\bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge\nradius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined\ncharge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying\nthreshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge\nform factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single\nCLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of\napproximately $a \\approx0.064 \\ \\mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\\pi \\approx\n290 \\ \\mathrm{MeV}$."}

High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \\approx\n2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \\approx \\{ 0.15, 0.12,\n0.09 \\}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_\\pi \\approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark\nflavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\\mathcal{T}_\\text{W} = 3a^2$,\nfinding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix\nelements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a\n\\approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit. Our\nfinal LaMET gluon PDF compares reasonably with select global-fit\ndeterminations, specifically preferring analyses which have near-zero gluonic\ndensity in the $x \\gtrsim 0.6$ region."}
