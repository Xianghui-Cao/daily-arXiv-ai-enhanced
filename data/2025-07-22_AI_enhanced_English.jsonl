It continues to enable theoretical\npredictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard\nModel. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum\ncomputing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In\nparticular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible\nfirst-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of\nequilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe,\nastrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and\nadvancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is\na vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle\nphysics.\n  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge\ntheories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and\nalgorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and\npractices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation\nof lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework,\nthe notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some\nelementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are\ndiscussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing\nbasics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory\nquantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is\nprovided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current\nunderstanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is\npresented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and\nreinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.", "AI": {"tldr": "The abstract discusses the potential of quantum computing in advancing lattice-gauge-theory, which is key to theoretical predictions in nuclear and particle physics.
