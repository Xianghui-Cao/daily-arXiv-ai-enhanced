### [1] [Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618)
*Sayak Guha Roy,Vaibhav Sharma,Kaidi Xu,Umberto Borla,Jad C. Halimeh,Kaden R. A. Hazzard*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study reveals a new repulsive binding mechanism in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, which forms a stable 'hadron' bound state of two mesons. This is achieved through resonant pair-production terms and the hadron's off-resonant coupling to a continuum. The researchers used matrix product state techniques for numerical simulations and derived an effective model explaining the formation, with potential for experimental observation on quantum hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore beyond the known confinement mechanism in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory where mesons do not bind without additional attractive interactions. The authors aim to demonstrate that under certain conditions, specifically with resonant pair-production, it is possible to form a stable bound state of two mesons, resembling a 'hadron', which has not been previously observed in the absence of extra attractive forces between particles.

Method: The method employed in this research involves the use of matrix product state (MPS) techniques, particularly the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, to simulate and analyze the dynamical formation of the 'hadron' bound state. Additionally, the researchers derive an effective theoretical model to explain the underlying mechanism of the bound state formation.

Result: The result of this paper is the discovery of a novel repulsive binding mechanism within the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, leading to the formation of a stable 'hadron' bound state composed of two mesons. The stability of this high-energy state is due to its off-resonant coupling to a continuum, and the findings suggest that such a bound state could be experimentally observed using current quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the introduction of resonant pair-production terms in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory leads to a new type of repulsive binding, resulting in a stable 'hadron' bound state. The results are significant as they provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics within the gauge theory and open up possibilities for experimental verification on modern quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: A paradigmatic model, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits
confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into
mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any
additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to
bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise
to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron''
bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by
being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation
of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product
state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to
perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on
hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its
formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern
quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.

### [2] [Quarkiton: a one-quark state near a boundary of confinement phase of QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24363)
*Maxim N. Chernodub,Vladimir A. Goy,Alexander V. Molochkov,Alexey S. Tanashkin*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the existence of a 'quarkiton' - a one-quark state near a reflective boundary that is partially confined, with a lower string tension than the fundamental. This state resembles surface excitons in metals and semiconductors and may exist at the hadronic side of QCD phase interfaces, such as those in vortical quark-gluon plasma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the behavior of a test quark near a reflective chromometallic boundary, both at finite and zero temperature, to understand the confinement mechanism and the potential existence of a new type of quark state, the 'quarkiton'.

Method: The authors use numerical simulations based on lattice Yang-Mills theory to study the interaction and confinement of a test quark near a reflective boundary.

Result: The results show that the test quark is confined by an attractive Cornell-type potential and forms a 'quarkiton' state with a string tension lower than the fundamental one. The quarkiton can move freely along the mirror while being localized near it, similar to surface excitons in materials science.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the 'quarkiton' state is a novel form of partial confinement, which has implications for the understanding of quark behavior at boundaries and phase interfaces within QCD, particularly in environments like vortical quark-gluon plasma.

Abstract: We discuss a one-quark state in the confinement phase near a reflective
chromometallic boundary both at finite and zero temperature. Using numerical
simulations of lattice Yang-Mills theory, we show that the test quark is
confined to the neutral mirror by an attractive potential of the Cornell type,
suggesting the existence of a mirror-bound one-quark state, a "quarkiton".
Surprisingly, the tension of the string spanned between the quark and the
mirror is lower than the fundamental string tension. The quarkiton state
exhibits a partial confinement: while the quark is localized in the vicinity of
the mirror, it can still travel freely along it. Such quarkiton states share
similarity with the surface excitons in metals and semiconductors that are
bound to their negatively charged images at a boundary. The quarkitons can
exist at the hadronic side of the phase interfaces in QCD that arise, for
example, in the thermodynamic equilibrium of vortical quark-gluon plasma.

### [3] [Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24381)
*Matteo Giordano*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of chiral symmetry restoration on the Dirac spectrum in two-flavor, finite-temperature gauge theories using lattice simulations with Ginsparg-Wilson fermions. It establishes criteria for chiral symmetry restoration based on the behavior of scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities as the quark mass approaches zero. The author derives constraints on the Dirac spectrum from the finiteness of these susceptibilities and discusses implications for the U(1)_A anomaly and topological properties of the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature affects the Dirac spectrum in the context of lattice QCD, and to explore the connection between the restoration of chiral symmetry and the behavior of the anomalous U(1)_A symmetry.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations with Ginsparg-Wilson fermions, mathematical proofs relating the behavior of scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities to the chiral limit, and analysis of the Dirac spectrum.

Result: Chiral symmetry is restored if and only if the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears do not diverge as the quark mass goes to zero, leading to specific differentiability conditions. Constraints on the Dirac spectrum are derived, and it is shown that the topological properties of the theory resemble those of an instanton gas when U(1)_A remains effectively broken.

Conclusion: The study provides a criterion for chiral symmetry restoration in terms of the non-divergence of certain susceptibilities, which imposes constraints on the Dirac spectrum and sheds light on the fate of the U(1)_A anomaly in the chiral limit.

Abstract: I study the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration for the Dirac
spectrum in finite-temperature gauge theories in the two-flavor chiral limit,
using Ginsparg--Wilson fermions on the lattice. I prove that chiral symmetry is
restored at the level of the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar
bilinears if and only if all these susceptibilities do not diverge in the
chiral limit $m\to 0$, with $m$ the common mass of the light fermions. This
implies in turn that they are infinitely differentiable functions of $m^2$ at
$m=0$, or $m$ times such a function, depending on whether they contain an even
or odd number of isosinglet bilinears. Expressing scalar and pseudoscalar
susceptibilities in terms of the Dirac spectrum, I use their finiteness in the
symmetric phase to derive constraints on the spectrum, and discuss the
resulting implications for the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry
in the chiral limit. I also discuss the differentiability properties of
spectral quantities with respect to $m^2$, and show from first principles that
the topological properties of the theory in the chiral limit are characterized
by an instanton gas-like behavior if $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ remains effectively
broken.

### [4] [Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24392)
*Matteo Giordano*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The author analyzes the implications of chiral symmetry restoration on the Dirac spectrum in gauge theories with two light fermion flavors, focusing on the anomalous U(1)_A symmetry. The study shows that effective U(1)_A breaking in the symmetric phase requires specific spectral features and suggests a mechanism for this breaking through the mixing of zero modes associated with topological objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration on the Dirac spectrum, particularly regarding the anomalous U(1)_A symmetry, and to identify the conditions under which U(1)_A breaking can occur in the symmetric phase of gauge theories with two light fermion flavors.

Method: The method involves making general, physically motivated assumptions about the spectral density and two-point eigenvalue correlation function, and then analyzing the necessary spectral features for effective U(1)_A breaking in the symmetric phase. It also includes proposing a scenario where a power-law divergent spectral peak and near-zero mobility edge are present, and discussing the role of topological object mixing in producing these features.

Result: The result is that for effective U(1)_A breaking to occur in the symmetric phase, there must be a spectral density behaving as m^2δ(λ), a singular two-point function at zero, delocalized near-zero modes, and an instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. A concrete physical mechanism involving the mixing of approximate zero modes from a dilute gas of topological objects is proposed to explain these features.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the mixing of approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a viable mechanism for effective U(1)_A breaking in the symmetric phase, characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak and a near-zero mobility edge.

Abstract: I discuss the consequences of the constraints imposed on the Dirac spectrum
by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the chiral limit of gauge theories
with two light fermion flavors, with particular attention to the fate of the
anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry. Under general, physically motivated
assumptions on the spectral density and on the two-point eigenvalue correlation
function, I show that effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric
phase requires specific spectral features, including a spectral density
effectively behaving as $m^2\delta(\lambda)$ in the chiral limit, a two-point
function singular at zero, and delocalized near-zero modes, besides an
instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. I then
discuss a $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law
divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|\lambda|$ in the chiral limit and
by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero
modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete
physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable
mechanism for effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a
gauge theory.

### [5] [Comment on "Chiral symmetry restoration, the eigenvalue density of the Dirac operator, and the axial U(1) anomaly at finite temperature"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24403)
*Matteo Giordano*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper disputes a claim made by Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi regarding the vanishing of the spectral density of the Dirac operator at the origin and the topological susceptibility for small but non-zero quark mass in the chirally symmetric phase of QCD. The author argues that a key part of their proof is not valid, calling for a reassessment of their conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to critically evaluate and challenge the validity of the conclusions drawn by Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi concerning the behavior of certain QCD observables in the presence of a small but non-zero quark mass, specifically within the context of the chirally symmetric phase.

Method: The author conducts a theoretical analysis, focusing on the specific assumptions and steps in the original proof provided by Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi. The approach involves identifying and scrutinizing the crucial step in their argument that the author believes to be unjustified.

Result: The result of the paper is that the author identifies a potentially flawed step in the original proof, suggesting that the claims about the vanishing of the spectral density of the Dirac operator and the topological susceptibility may not hold under the conditions specified by Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi.

Conclusion: The conclusion reached by the author is that the findings of Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi should be re-evaluated, as the proof supporting their claims contains a step that the author contends is not justified. This calls into question the validity of their conclusions regarding the behavior of QCD observables in the chirally symmetric phase with a small quark mass.

Abstract: Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi claim that both the spectral density of the Dirac
operator at the origin and the topological susceptibility must vanish
identically for sufficiently small but nonzero mass $m$ in the chirally
symmetric phase of QCD with two light quark flavors, under certain technical
assumptions on the spectrum and on the dependence of observables on $m$.
Independently of these assumptions, I argue that a crucial step of their proof
is not justified, and the validity of these conclusions should be reassessed.

### [6] [Low-lying baryon resonances from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24596)
*Colin Morningstar*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in imaginary time to calculate baryon resonance properties, employing a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method. It extracts stationary state energies from temporal correlations and uses a quantization condition with K-matrix and box matrix to obtain a finite-volume energy spectrum. The methodology is applied to the Δ resonance and a two-pole structure near the Λ(1405) resonance, with prospects for studying the Roper resonance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a non-perturbative approach to calculate the properties of baryon resonances using lattice QCD, which allows for the evaluation of temporal correlations between hadronic operators through numerical integration over field configurations. This work aims to refine the understanding of baryon resonances by matching the finite-volume spectrum obtained from Monte Carlo computations with that predicted by the scattering K-matrix formalism.

Method: The method involves formulating QCD on a space-time lattice in imaginary time, using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling to carry out the necessary integrations. The energies of stationary states are extracted from the temporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering K-matrix and a box matrix is used to derive a finite-volume energy spectrum, and the parameters of the K-matrix are adjusted to match the spectrum from Monte Carlo calculations.

Result: The results include the presentation of data for the Δ resonance and the identification of a two-pole structure in the scattering analysis near the Λ(1405) resonance. The study also outlines the potential application of the same methodology to investigate the Roper resonance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the lattice QCD approach, combined with the use of a K-matrix parametrization, provides a viable method for studying baryon resonances, and the agreement between the finite-volume spectra and the K-matrix predictions suggests that this technique can be effectively used to analyze other resonances, such as the Roper resonance.

Abstract: Calculating the properties of baryon resonances from quantum chromodynamics
requires evaluating the temporal correlations between hadronic operators using
integrations over field configurations weighted by a phase associated with the
action. By formulating quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice in
imaginary time, such integrations can be carried out non-perturbatively using a
Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling. The energies of
stationary states in the finite volume of the lattice can be extracted from the
temporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering
$K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy
spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the
best-fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those that produce a
finite-volume spectrum which most closely matches that obtained from the Monte
Carlo computations. Results for the $\Delta$ resonance are presented, and a
study of scattering for energies near the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance is
outlined, showing a two pole structure. The prospects for applying this
methodology to the Roper resonance are discussed.
