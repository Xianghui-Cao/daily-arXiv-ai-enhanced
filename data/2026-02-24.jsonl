Comments and suggestions are welcome", "summary": "We determine the zero eigenmode spectrum of Minimally Doubled Fermions (MDF), namely in Karsten-Wilczek (KW) and Borici-Creutz (BC) formulations on the 4-dimensional space-time lattice. We employ background gauge fields with integer valued topological charges. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem is verified in the presence of two different background gauge fields, namely Smit-Vink [1] and cooled down MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ dynamical flavors of quarks [2]. Using flavored mass terms [3,4], we find that the spectral flow of the eigenvalues detects the topology of the background gauge field. With the use of the modified chirality operator, we obtain chiralities of the zero eigenmodes and the fermionic topological charge."}

Chiral perturbation theory predicts that its experimental spectrum may be explained by a two pole structure originating in the $SU(3)$ chiral dynamics of the baryon-meson interaction. The $SU(3)$-symmetric flavor point is readily accessible in lattice QCD, in this work we study the baryon-meson states directly at this point. We construct interpolation operators that belong to the irreducible representations of $SU(3)$ that are attractive in the channel with the quantum numbers of the (singlet and two octets). The extracted energy levels can be used as input for chiral perturbation theory to find the poles associated with each representation. The relevant correlation functions are computed on $SU(3)$-symmetric ensembles with $M_π\\approx 714$ MeV using the distillation technique."}
