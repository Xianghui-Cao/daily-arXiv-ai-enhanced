### [1] [$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ lattice gauge theories with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26904)
*Simone Romiti*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to study SU(Nc) lattice gauge theories, successfully reproducing the energy levels and wavefunctions for U(1) and SU(2) pure-gauge theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to apply PINNs to learn eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of SU(Nc) lattice gauge theories across different gauge couplings, from strong-coupling to weak-coupling regimes, where exact solutions may not be available.

Method: The method involves using PINNs with a loss function that encodes the Schrödinger equation and the symmetries of the eigenstates, allowing the network to perform an unsupervised learning of the spectrum.

Result: The results show that PINNs are able to accurately reproduce the hierarchy of energy levels and their corresponding wavefunctions for single-plaquette U(1) and SU(2) pure-gauge theories, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that PINNs can effectively explore the spectrum of lattice gauge theories, providing a promising tool for studying these theories in regimes where analytical solutions are not available.

Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the
study of $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theories. Our method enables the
learning of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues at arbitrary gauge couplings,
smoothly moving from the analytically known strong-coupling regime towards
weaker couplings. By encoding the Schr\"odinger equation and the symmetries of
the eigenstates directly into the loss function, the network performs an
unsupervised exploration of the spectrum. We validate the approach on the
single-plaquette $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ pure-gauge theories,
showing that the PINNs successfully reproduce the hierarchy of energy levels
and their corresponding wavefunctions.

Abstract: In this work, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the branching ratios
and the form factors of radiative leptonic decays $P \to \ell \nu_\ell \gamma$
($P = \pi, K$) using $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion ensembles generated by the
RBC and UKQCD collaborations at the physical pion mass. We adopt the infinite
volume reconstruction (IVR) method, which extends lattice data to infinite
volume and effectively controls the finite volume effects. This study
represents a first step toward a complete calculation of radiative corrections
to leptonic decays using the IVR method, including both real photon emissions
and virtual photon loops. For decays involving a final state electron,
collinear radiative corrections, enhanced by the large logarithmic factors such
as $\ln(m_\pi^2/m_e^2)$ and $\ln(m_K^2/m_e^2)$, can reach the level of
$O(10\%)$ and are essential at the current level of theoretical and
experimental precision. After including these corrections, our result for $\pi
\to e\nu_e\gamma$ agrees with the PIBETA measurement; for \(K \to
e\nu_e\gamma\), our results are consistent with the KLOE data and exhibit a
$1.7\sigma$ tension with E36; and for $K \to \mu\nu_\mu\gamma$, where radiative
corrections are negligible, our results confirm the previously observed
discrepancies between lattice results and the ISTRA/OKA measurements at large
photon energies, and with the E787 results at large muon photon angles.

### [3] [Spectrum of the SU(2) scalar-fermion-gauge system under the influence of the Brout-Englert-Higgs effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27457)
*Georg Wieland,Axel Maas*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the Fröhlich-Morchio-Strocchi (FMS) mechanism's impact on fermionic observables in the Standard Model using non-perturbative lattice techniques, determining the physical spectrum and setting up for future scattering analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the FMS mechanism, which predicts additional Higgs contributions in SM processes, and its unexplored effects on fermionic observables, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the Standard Model.

Method: The authors use non-perturbative lattice techniques within a gauge-invariant framework to study a proxy theory of the weak sector that includes dynamical fermions. They determine the physical spectrum and identify simulation points for further scattering analysis.

Result: The results include the determination of the physical spectrum of the theory, which is interpreted in the context of the FMS mechanism, and the identification of suitable simulation points for future scattering analyses relevant to lepton colliders.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely emphasize the importance of the findings for the FMS mechanism and their implications for the Standard Model, particularly in relation to fermionic observables and potential future collider experiments.

Abstract: Gauge invariance requires physical states to be composite, even in the weak
sector of the Standard Model (SM). The Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi (FMS)
mechanism resolves this subtlety and predicts additional Higgs contributions in
SM processes. While this has been supported by theoretical investigations in
the bosonic sector, its impact on fermionic observables remains largely
unexplored. We use non-perturbative lattice techniques within a gauge-invariant
framework to study a proxy theory of the weak sector with dynamical fermions.
We determine the physical spectrum of the theory and interpret the results in
the context of the FMS mechanism. Additionally, we identify suitable simulation
points for a scattering analysis as a first step toward cross-sections relevant
to (future lepton) colliders.

*Timo Jacobs,Marco Garofalo,Tobias Hartung,Karl Jansen,Paul Ludwig,Johann Ostmeyer,Simone Romiti,Carsten Urbach*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper compares different truncation schemes for U(1) Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) using tensor network states and finds that a plaquette state basis outperforms other methods, especially in two spatial dimensions. It also suggests the potential of Green's function Monte Carlo for verifying tensor network states results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find an effective finite-dimensional approximation of the Hilbert space for simulating Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT), particularly for U(1) LGTs, which can be used with tensor network state methods or quantum computers. The aim is to identify the best truncation scheme that provides accurate results with a minimal number of basis states.

Method: The researchers compare various truncation schemes for U(1) Lattice Gauge Theories by using tensor network states. They focus on evaluating the performance of these schemes based on the accuracy of results for the plaquette, ground state energy, and mass gap across a range of coupling strengths, with a special emphasis on the efficiency of the basis in terms of the number of states required.

Result: The study reveals that the functional basis derived from single plaquette Hamiltonians, referred to as the plaquette state basis, is superior to other truncation schemes in two spatial dimensions. This basis delivers accurate results over a wide range of coupling strengths while utilizing a minimal number of basis states. Additionally, the plaquette state basis shows promise for use in three spatial dimensions. The paper also highlights the usefulness of Green's function Monte Carlo as a verification tool for tensor network states results.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the plaquette state basis is an optimal choice for representing U(1) Lattice Gauge Theories in simulations, providing both accuracy and efficiency. The research also opens up the possibility for further exploration of Green's function Monte Carlo as a method to validate tensor network states results.

Abstract: A representation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) suitable for simulations
with tensor network state methods or with quantum computers requires a
truncation of the Hilbert space to a finite dimensional approximation. In
particular for U(1) LGTs, several such truncation schemes are known, which we
compare with each other using tensor network states. We show that a functional
basis obtained from single plaquette Hamiltonians -- which we call plaquette
state basis -- outperforms the other schemes in two spatial dimensions for
plaquette, ground state energy and mass gap, as it is delivering accurate
results for a wide range of coupling strengths with a minimal number of basis
states. We also show that this functional basis can be efficiently used in
three spatial dimensions. Green's function Monte Carlo appears to be a highly
useful tool to verify tensor network states results, which deserves further
investigation in the future.

### [5] [Scalable quantum computation of Quantum Electrodynamics beyond one spatial dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27668)
*Zong-Gang Mou,Bipasha Chakraborty*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A scalable quantum algorithm for simulating Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) that preserves gauge invariance and is designed to be implemented on quantum computers, showing promise for large-scale simulations on future quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the exponential scaling of Quantum Field Theory calculations with spatial volume, which makes real-time simulations infeasible on classical computers, and to handle the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space introduced by bosonic fields in a way that maintains gauge invariance.

Method: The method involves developing a quantum algorithm for QED that is scalable and ensures gauge invariance through lattice discretization, digitization, and qubitization. The researchers also benchmarked various quantum error mitigation techniques, finding the calibration method to be the most effective.

Result: The results show that the approach can scale to larger lattices, and the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups have been tested on current quantum hardware. The findings suggest that next-generation quantum platforms could support reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED dynamics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed quantum algorithm for QED is a promising solution for simulating complex quantum field theories on quantum computers, with the potential to enable significant advancements in the field as quantum technology progresses.

Abstract: In the Hamiltonian formulation, Quantum Field Theory calculations scale
exponentially with spatial volume, making real-time simulations intractable on
classical computers and motivating quantum computation approaches. In
Hamiltonian quantisation, bosonic fields introduce the additional challenge of
an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a scalable quantum algorithm
for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an Abelian gauge field theory in higher than
one spatial dimensions, designed to address this limit while preserving gauge
invariance. In our formulation, Gauss's law is automatically satisfied when the
implementation remains fully gauge invariant. We demonstrate how gauge
invariance is maintained throughout the lattice discretisation, digitisation,
and qubitisation procedures, and identify the most efficient representation for
extending to large Hilbert space dimensions. Within this framework, we
benchmark several quantum error mitigation techniques and find the calibration
method to perform most effectively. The approach scales naturally to larger
lattices, and we implement and test the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups on
current quantum hardware. Our results indicate that next-generation quantum
platforms could enable reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED
dynamics.
