TL;DR: A new numerical algorithm for the modified Lüsher zeta-function is introduced, which is robust against long-range forces and shows minimal impact from truncating higher partial waves. The paper also addresses the regularization and renormalization of this function, resolving issues with cutoff regularization, leading to natural-sized effective range expansion parameters.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon the standard Lüsher approach by developing a more efficient and accurate method for calculating the modified Lüsher zeta-function, especially in scenarios involving long-range forces, and to address the challenges of regularization and renormalization.

Method: The researchers utilize a formalism from a previous study to analyze synthetic data on finite-volume energy levels. They propose a new numerical algorithm that is less sensitive to the truncation of higher partial waves and introduce a renormalization scheme to handle the modified Lüsher zeta-function.

Result: The results show that the new algorithm's final result is not significantly affected by the truncation of higher partial waves, unlike the standard Lüsher approach. Additionally, the proposed renormalization scheme yields effective range expansion parameters of a natural size across all partial waves, even when dealing with cutoff regularization problems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed numerical algorithm and renormalization scheme provide a more reliable and stable method for computing the modified Lüsher zeta-function, particularly in the presence of long-range forces, and that it leads to physically meaningful effective range parameters.

Abstract: An efficient numerical algoritm is proposed for the calculation of the
modified L\"uscher zeta-function in the presence of a long-range force. Using
the formalism developed in Ref.~\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of
synthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is
demonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\"uscher approach, the
truncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final
result. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified
L\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising
within the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization
scheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range
expansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.
