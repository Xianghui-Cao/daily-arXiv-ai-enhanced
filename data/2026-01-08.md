### [1] [Phases of the $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at large $N$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03843)
*Tomoya Hayata,Yoshimasa Hidaka,Hiromasa Watanabe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory on a lattice, exploring how confinement and topological order vary with parameters N, g, and k. A mean-field analysis reveals that topological order is robust at large N, suggesting a more complex continuum limit than expected, which calls for further studies beyond mean-field theory.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the key properties of (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory, such as confinement and topological order, and to explore their behavior under different parameter regimes. The authors aim to provide insights into the large-N phase structure and to guide future quantum simulations and theoretical studies of large-N gauge theories.

Method: The method involves a variational mean-field analysis applied to the (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory within the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. The analysis interpolates between strong- and weak-coupling regimes to study the phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling and the ratio k/N.

Result: The results show that the topologically ordered phase is robust at large N when the parameters are appropriately scaled. This finding suggests that the continuum limit of the large-N gauge theory may be more intricate than initially thought, indicating the need for studies that go beyond mean-field approximations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the topological order in (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(N)_k Yang-Mills theory remains stable at large N, pointing to a more nuanced continuum limit. This work motivates further research to better understand confinement and to aid in the development of quantum simulations for large-N gauge theories.

Abstract: We investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)_k$ Yang-Mills theory in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism, which is characterized by three parameters: the number of colors $N$, the coupling constant $g$, and the level $k$. By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $λ_\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.

*Stephen R. Sharpe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper reviews the recent advancements in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties for three-particle systems using lattice QCD, with a focus on the transition from finite-volume spectrum input to integral equation solutions that can identify resonance poles, and it discusses future potential developments.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide an overview of the current state of research in using lattice QCD for the calculation of three-particle scattering amplitudes and resonances, and to highlight the importance of these calculations for understanding the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Method: The method involves using lattice QCD to compute the finite-volume spectrum as input, which is then processed through the solution of integral equations to obtain scattering amplitudes. These amplitudes are analytically continued into the complex energy plane to locate resonance poles.

Result: The result is a set of methodologies and techniques that allow for the accurate calculation of three-particle scattering processes and the determination of resonance properties, providing a deeper insight into the non-perturbative regime of QCD.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the methods described have been successful in advancing our understanding of three-particle interactions and that there is a promising outlook for further applications and extensions of this work.

Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.
