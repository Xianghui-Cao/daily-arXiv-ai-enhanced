Herein, the relative scale setting for different $\u03b2$'s is discussed, using the Landau gauge gluon propagator computed with large statistical ensembles. After setting the relative scales, finite size effects are observed in the ultraviolet regime and handled in an effective description, inspired in perturbation theory. The new devised procedure is efficient in handling the finite size effects, linking the lattice simulations with continuum perturbation theory for the high momenta regime. Furthermore, the procedure can be extended to handle other Green functions computed within lattice QCD simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a new method for scale setting in lattice QCD simulations, which efficiently addresses finite size effects and links the simulations to continuum perturbation theory, applicable to other Green functions as well.", "motivation": "The motivation of this paper is to improve the accuracy of physical predictions from lattice QCD simulations by developing an efficient method for scale setting that also accounts for finite size effects in the ultraviolet regime.", "method": "The authors use the Landau gauge gluon propagator with large statistical ensembles to set relative scales for different \u03b2 values.
