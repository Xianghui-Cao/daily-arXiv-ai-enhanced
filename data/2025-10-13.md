Abstract: The mass of the lightest hadron in nature, the pion, is one seventh of that
of the nucleon, and one tenth of the mass of its first excited state, the
$\pi(1300)$. This enormous energy difference opens an interesting window into
the confinement of quarks and the structure of the lightest hadrons. In this
work, we provide the first calculation of resonance parameters of the
$\pi(1300)$ from lattice QCD. For this purpose, recently derived
state-of-the-art tools are adapted and applied both in the construction of
three-hadron operators and for mapping finite-volume spectra to infinite-volume
amplitudes, subsequently analytically continuing these to complex energies. For
our heavy pion mass ensembles, we find a clear signal of the resonance. Crucial
input is provided through Chiral Perturbation Theory, allowing us to robustly
extrapolate to the physical point. Applying model averaging, we extract a pole
position of $M_{\pi(1300)}=(1169\pm46)-i\,(62_{-62}^{+168})\,\rm MeV$
supporting values from phenomenology.
