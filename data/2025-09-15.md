It also demonstrates a zero-shot learning ability for different sized Dirac operators.

Motivation: To address the computational challenges associated with solving large, sparse, and ill-conditioned Hermitian positive definite systems in lattice QCD, particularly to reduce the time and cost of iterative methods like Conjugate Gradient (CG).

Method: The authors propose a novel framework that uses operator learning to create effective preconditioners without relying on explicit matrices from the original system or the preconditioner, thus facilitating efficient training and use within the CG solver.

Result: The proposed preconditioning scheme is shown to significantly decrease the condition number of the linear systems and approximately halve the number of iterations required for the CG method to converge, especially in the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory. Additionally, the learned preconditioner can be applied to Dirac operators of different sizes without additional training, showcasing its zero-shot learning capability.

Conclusion: The introduction of an operator learning-based preconditioning framework offers a promising approach to accelerate the solution of linear systems in lattice QCD, with potential for broad applicability across various system sizes and configurations.

Abstract: Linear systems arise in generating samples and in calculating observables in
lattice quantum chromodynamics~(QCD). Solving the Hermitian positive definite
systems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative
methods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and
computationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this
process, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However,
constructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional
computational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a
framework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as
effective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit
matrices from either the original linear systems or the produced
preconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG
solver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1
spacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning
scheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and
approximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in
relevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a
general mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot
learning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field
configurations of different sizes.

### [2] [Sparse modeling study of extracting charmonium spectral functions from lattice QCD at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10386)
*Junichi Takahashi,Hiroshi Ohno,Akio Tomiya*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of sparse modeling (SpM) for extracting spectral functions from Euclidean-time correlation functions, finding that while SpM can reconstruct resonance peaks, it struggles with transport peaks. The method is tested on mock data and applied to lattice QCD data, showing qualitative consistency with the maximum entropy method, but with limitations in resolving transport peaks.

Motivation: The motivation is to assess the applicability of sparse modeling (SpM) as a technique for solving inverse problems when extracting spectral functions from Euclidean-time correlation functions, particularly in the context of charmonium states and lattice QCD.

Method: Sparse modeling (SpM) is used to extract spectral functions from Euclidean-time correlation functions. The method is first tested on mock data resembling charmonium correlation functions, and then on actual lattice QCD data at different temperatures.

Result: While SpM successfully reconstructs resonance peaks in the spectral functions, it has difficulty reconstructing transport peaks without additional assumptions. When applied to lattice QCD data, the results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained using the maximum entropy method, but the transport peak is not clearly resolved.

Conclusion: The sparse modeling approach can partially reflect the underlying physics of the system, especially in the reconstruction of resonance peaks, but it is limited in its ability to resolve transport peaks, suggesting that further assumptions or methods may be required for a complete analysis.

Abstract: We present spectral functions extracted from Euclidean-time correlation
functions using sparse modeling (SpM). SpM solves inverse problems by
considering only the sparsity of the target solution. To assess the
applicability of the method, we first test it with mock data that mimic
charmonium correlation functions. We show that, while resonance peaks in the
spectral functions can be reconstructed using this method, it is difficult to
reconstruct transport peaks without further assumptions beyond SpM. Then we
extract charmonium spectral functions from correlation functions obtained from
lattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature. We show
that this method yields results qualitatively consistent with those obtained
using the maximum entropy method, although the transport peak is not obtained
clearly. This suggests that the results solely from the assumption of the
sparse solution can partially reflect underlying physics.
