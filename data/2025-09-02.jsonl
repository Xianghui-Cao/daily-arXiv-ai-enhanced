In this\nwork, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this\ncontribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We\nfind relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and\ndemonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single\nlattice spacing of $a^{-1} \\approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\\pi \\approx 275$ MeV."}

The glueball GFFs are compared with those\nof other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing\nstrong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than\ntypical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting\nprevious suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than\nother hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun\ncharacteristic to target by experimental glueball searches."}
