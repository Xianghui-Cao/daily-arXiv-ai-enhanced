Here we present first results from our new ensemble which\nhas a temporal lattice spacing a_t=15am and anisotropy xi=a_s/a_t=7, giving\nunprecedented resolution in the temporal direction. We show results for the\nchiral transition, vector-axial-vector degeneracy, and heavy quarkonium, and\ncompare them with earlier results with coarser time resolution."}

We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to\nobtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the\n$\\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of\nvalidity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by\nmeans of lattice simulations."}

Free limit", "comment": "26 pages, 14 figures", "summary": "To investigate the three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the radial\nquantization on the lattice, the lattice action is constructed and the free\nlimit is studied on $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. With the overlap fermion, it is\nnumerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be\nrealized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to\nthe lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The\n$O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit,\nand the number of reproduced descendant states is estimated heuristically for\nthe first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of\nthe theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning."}
