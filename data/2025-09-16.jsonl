The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory\nfrom the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is\ngenerally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient\nflow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The\nprimary focus is on the running coupling $\\alpha_S(\\mu)$, from which\nconfinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon\ncondensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across\ndifferent scales. Building on that, we derive $\\alpha_S(\\mu) \\simeq\n\\Lambda_S^2/\\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\\alpha_S = 0$\nin accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor\nis the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which\nis a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical\nstatements are supported by numerical simulations."}

This formulation\nextends the previously proposed oblique decomposition and it is assessed on\nthree representative problems: the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the trace\nof the full Dirac operator's inverse $\\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, and disconnected\nfermion loops. For the connected correlator, variance reductions grow\nsystematically with the time separation and lead to cost savings of up to a\nfactor of 30 at large separations, outperforming both the plain Hutchinson's\nestimator and the oblique formulation. For $\\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, reductions\nare more modest but remain systematic, with stronger effects on more\nill-conditioned systems. Disconnected loops show no improvement, since their\nvariance is dominated by local same-slice contributions not targeted by the\ndecomposition."}

Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest\ncouplings, respectively. In particular, the values of $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22,\n0.23, 0.24, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8,$ and 1.0 are considered in our study. Based on the\nnumerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20,\n0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising\nuniversality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that\nthere are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase\ntransitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is\nunlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for\n$J_2/|J_1|$ $\\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation\ntimes or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature\nregion. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available\nresults in the literature is briefly conducted as well."}
