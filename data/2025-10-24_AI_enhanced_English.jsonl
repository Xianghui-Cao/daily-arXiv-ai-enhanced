The sea sector is based on gauge\nensembles with $N_{\\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved\nWilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)\ninitiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five\nvalues of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the\nphysical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ\nWilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless\nWilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the\nstrategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses\nalong the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is\nthen conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action\napproach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion\nregularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,\nwe conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the\nmasses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow\nscale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct\nways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their\ncombination. We observe that the latter combination results in enhanced control\nof the systematic uncertainties, thereby yielding a precise determination of\nthe physical value of $t_0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a lattice QCD mixed action approach using Wilson-type quarks in both sea and valence sectors, with a focus on mass matching and a universality test. It also describes a scale setting procedure for the gradient flow scale $t_0$ using pion and kaon masses and decay constants, which when combined with the unitary and mixed-action approaches, provides a precise determination of $t_0$ with reduced systematic uncertainties.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a robust lattice QCD mixed action approach that can accurately match sea and valence quark masses and conduct a precise universality test by comparing results from mixed-action and unitary setups. Additionally, the work aims to set a scale for the gradient flow scale $t_0$ with high precision and control over systematic uncertainties.", "method": "The method involves using gauge ensembles with 2+1 flavors of O($a$)-improved Wilson fermions for the sea sector, and Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist for the valence sector. The authors perform a mass matching between the sea and valence quarks, conduct a universality test, and use the resulting data to set the scale for the gradient flow scale $t_0$ using pion and kaon observables.", "result": "The result is a successful implementation of a mixed action approach with good agreement between the unitary and mixed-action results, and an enhanced control of systematic uncertainties in the determination of the physical value of $t_0$ when combining both approaches.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the mixed-action approach with Wilson-type quarks in both sectors, along with the careful matching of quark masses, provides a viable and accurate framework for lattice QCD calculations, including the scale setting for the gradient flow scale $t_0$. The combination of unitary and mixed-action results improves the precision of the scale setting."}}
