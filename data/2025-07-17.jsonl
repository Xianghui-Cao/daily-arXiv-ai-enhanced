It is shown that color electric/magnetic fields have\ntwo components: the first part is a gradient/curl component, respectively, and\nthe second part is a nonlinear component. It is shown that the color electric\nfield has a Y-like spatial distribution. Such a Y-like behavior arises because\nthe gradient component of the electric field is present. The nonlinear\ncomponent of the electric field is a curl one, and it appears because the\nvector potential sourced by a solenoidal current is present. The color magnetic\nfield is purely curl one, since its nonzero color components do not contain a\nnonlinear component; this results in the fact that its force lines lie on the\nsurface of a torus. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement\nwith the results obtained in lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics. To\ndiscuss such an agreement, we consider a procedure of nonperturbative\nquantization and discuss possible approximations ensuring such an agreement.\nAlso, we compare the energy profile obtained by us with that obtained in\nlattice calculations with a static potential."}
