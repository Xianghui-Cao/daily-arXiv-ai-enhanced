Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a =(0.052-0.105$) fm, and pion mass $m_\u03c0 \\approx (136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\\perp} \\sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits.

The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase in 4D field theories with an SU(3) gauge group and 8 fundamental fermions, suggesting its existence both on the lattice and in the continuum limit, which could offer a new UV completion of the standard model and implications for physics beyond it.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore the possibility of a Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase in 4D, which could provide a new ultraviolet (UV) completion of the standard model and open up new scenarios for physics beyond the standard model, by studying systems with an SU(3) gauge group and 8 fundamental fermions.", "method": "The authors investigate 4D field theories, specifically focusing on the SU(3) gauge group with 8 flavors of fundamental fermions, through theoretical analysis and likely numerical simulations, to determine whether such a system exhibits the SMG phase.", "result": "The results suggest that the SU(3) gauge theory with 8 fundamental fermions indeed supports an SMG phase, not only in lattice simulations but also when considering the infinite cutoff continuum limit.", "conclusion": "If confirmed, the presence of an SMG phase in this 4D SU(3) gauge theory with 8 fundamental fermions would introduce a potential new UV completion of the standard model and contribute to the exploration of physics beyond the standard model."}}
