### [1] [Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790)
*Paulo A. Faria da Veiga,Luiz A. Ferreira,Henrique Malavazzi,Ravi Mistry*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the quantum properties of conserved, gauge-invariant charges in 2D Yang-Mills theories, particularly in lattice QCD under strong coupling. It uses the Feynman-Kac formalism to calculate the correlation functions of these charges on baryon and meson states, showing that hadrons carry these charges which are not confined.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the quantum behavior of truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges within the context of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, especially in the realm of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at strong coupling, and to explore their implications for confinement and hadron structure.

Method: The method involves constructing the gauge-invariant charges using the integral form of the Yang-Mills equations, and then applying the Feynman-Kac formalism to evaluate the correlation functions of these charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N), where N=2,3, and Grassmannian variables representing fermionic fields.

Result: The results indicate that the lowest non-trivial gauge-invariant charges have non-zero expectation values for baryon and meson states, while they are zero for non-gauge-invariant states, suggesting that hadrons do indeed carry these unconfined charges.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that there is a potential link between the presence of gauge-invariant charges and the phenomenon of confinement, as hadronic states exhibit these charges, which are not observed in non-gauge-invariant states. Further analysis of renormalization effects and higher-order contributions is needed to fully understand the relationship.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and
conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice
QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the
integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they
correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the
charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry
them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of
those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the
gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields.
Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges
are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant
states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges.
While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be
analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant
charges and confinement.

### [2] [Phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional dense two-color QCD at $T=0$ in the strong coupling limit with tensor renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23637)
*Yuto Sugimoto,Shinichiro Akiyama,Yoshinobu Kuramashi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional two-color QCD at zero temperature but with a finite chemical potential, using the tensor renormalization group method. It compares results for chiral and diquark condensates and quark number density against mean field approximation, and discusses critical exponents related to diquark condensation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional strong coupling two-color QCD under conditions of zero temperature and finite chemical potential, and to compare numerical findings with analytical predictions from the mean field approximation, particularly in the context of diquark condensation phenomena.

Method: The study employs the tensor renormalization group method to numerically evaluate the chiral and diquark condensates as well as the quark number density as functions of the chemical potential. This approach is used to analyze the system's behavior and extract critical exponents associated with diquark condensation.

Result: Results include the evaluation of chiral and diquark condensates, along with the quark number density, as functions of the chemical potential. These outcomes are compared with previous analytical work done using the mean field approximation, and insights into the critical exponents related to the diquark condensation are provided.

Conclusion: The research provides a detailed numerical investigation into the phase structure of two-color QCD under specific conditions, offering a comparison with mean field approximation and contributing to the understanding of critical exponents in diquark condensation.

Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional strong coupling
two-color QCD at zero temperature with finite chemical potential using the
tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and diquark condensates and the
quark number density are evaluated as a function of the chemical potential. Our
results are compared with the previous analytical results using the mean field
approximation. The critical exponents associated with the diquark condensation
are also discussed.

### [3] [A lattice QCD study of low-energy interactions of doubly charmed baryons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24649)
*Jing-Yu Yi,Ze-Rui Liang,Liuming Liu,De-Liang Yao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a lattice QCD calculation of the S-wave interactions between spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons, using specific CLQCD ensembles. It investigates four single-channel interactions and utilizes Lüscher's finite volume method to extract scattering parameters, which are found to agree with previous baryon chiral perturbation theory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a quantitative understanding of the S-wave interactions between spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons through a lattice QCD calculation, offering a comparison with theoretical predictions from baryon chiral perturbation theory.

Method: The method involves lattice QCD calculations on $N_f=2+1$ CLQCD ensembles with a particular lattice spacing and pion masses. The researchers investigate four specific single-channel interactions that do not involve disconnected diagrams. They apply Lüscher's finite volume method to derive scattering lengths and effective ranges from the finite-volume spectra.

Result: The results include the extraction of scattering parameters such as scattering lengths and effective ranges for the four investigated single-channel interactions, which show good agreement with prior predictions made by baryon chiral perturbation theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that the calculated scattering parameters using lattice QCD methods are consistent with those predicted by baryon chiral perturbation theory, thereby supporting the validity of the theoretical framework in describing the S-wave interactions of interest.

Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the S-wave interactions between the
spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons ($\Xi_{cc},\Omega_{cc}$) and Goldstone bosons
($\pi,K,\bar{K}$) using the $N_f=2+1$ CLQCD ensembles with lattice spacing $a =
0.07746$ fm and two pion masses $M_\pi \simeq 210$ and 300 MeV. Four
single-channel interactions, $I=1/2$ $\Omega_{cc}\bar{K}$, $I=1$ $\Xi_{cc}K$,
$I=0$ $\Xi_{cc}K$ and $I=3/2$ $\Xi_{cc}\pi$, are investigated, since they are
free of disconnected diagrams. L\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to
extract the scattering parameters in the effective range expansion, i.e., the
scattering lengths and effective ranges, from the finite-volume spectra. Our
obtained results agree well with previous baryon chiral perturbation theory
predictions.

### [4] [Finite-volume formalism for $Nππ$ at maximal isospin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24778)
*Maxwell T. Hansen,Fernando Romero-López,Stephen R. Sharpe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper extends the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to Nππ scattering states at maximal isospin (I=5/2), providing a quantization condition and integral equations. It includes a numerical example with the Δ resonance, discusses limitations in I=3/2 and 1/2 channels, and examines singularities from Nπππ intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to extend the existing formalism for calculating scattering amplitudes to more complex systems involving three particles, specifically to Nππ scattering states with maximal isospin. The authors aim to provide a theoretical framework that can account for the spin of the nucleon and non-degenerate particles, as well as to explore the complications arising from mixing with Nπ states in lower isospin channels.

Method: The method involves developing a quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to K matrices, which are then connected to physical scattering amplitudes through integral equations. The K matrices are parametrized, and the new features due to the nucleon's spin and non-degenerate particle use are addressed. A numerical application with the Δ resonance is provided, and singularities from Nπππ intermediate states are studied.

Result: The results include the derivation of a quantization condition and integral equations for Nππ scattering states at I=5/2. A sample numerical application is given, demonstrating the inclusion of the Δ resonance in the Nπ subchannel. The study also finds that subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid singularities from Nπππ intermediate states. Limitations are noted for I=3/2 and 1/2 channels where mixing with Nπ states occurs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with an extension of the formalism to Nππ scattering at I=5/2, but notes that the treatment of I=3/2 and 1/2 channels is incomplete due to the complexity introduced by mixing with Nπ states. It sets the stage for future work on fully treating all Nππ ↔ Nπ systems and provides groundwork for dealing with singularities in the amplitudes.

Abstract: We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N \pi
\pi$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using
the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic
low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that
relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral
equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We
discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new
features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin
of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a
concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the
$\Delta$ resonance in the $N\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and
$1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\pi$ states, and we do
not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\pi$ states
cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\pi$
scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering
using the three-particle $DD\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for
all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the
groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\pi\pi \leftrightarrow N\pi$
systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\pi\pi$
amplitudes arising from $N\pi\pi\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our
subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.
