These findings have highlighted the importance of understanding charmed\nhadron interactions. With significant advances in theory and computation,\nlattice QCD has become a reliable tool for studying nonperturbative dynamics of\nlow-energy QCD. In this talk, I review recent lattice QCD studies of charmed\nhadron interactions, focusing on three representative systems: $D^*$-$D$,\n$N$-$c\\bar c$, and $\\Omega_{ccc}$-$\\Omega_{ccc}$."}

Effective\nPolyakov loop theories derived from lattice QCD via combined strong-coupling\nand hopping expansions are valid for heavy quarks only, but tractable with a\nsignificantly less severe sign problem. In this work, we apply three mean-field\napproximations to these effective theories, each incorporating local\nfluctuations to different degrees. We compare their predictions against Monte\nCarlo results for the deconfinement transition at high temperatures and for the\nbaryon onset transition at low temperatures. In agreement with earlier\neffective theory simulations, we find a first-order nuclear liquid-gas\ntransition with a critical end point for very low temperatures and moderately\nheavy quarks. While the location of fluctuation-dominated critical end points\nis expectedly inaccurate, the phase diagram of lattice QCD with heavy quarks\ncan be determined qualitatively with entirely analytical methods."}

It is known that $\\langle\n\\bar{\\psi} \\psi \\rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\\langle F^2\n\\rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For\nthe recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom\nseparate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that\n$\\langle F^2 \\rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't\ncontribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale\ninvariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us\nto define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of\nIR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we\nexpress the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density."}
