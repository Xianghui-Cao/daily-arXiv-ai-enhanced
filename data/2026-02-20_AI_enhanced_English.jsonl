In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a method to identify and control excited-state contamination, a key source of uncertainty in lattice QCD calculations for hadron structure, using meson dominance and the variational method, with support from numerical data and chiral perturbation theory.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the challenge of excited-state contamination which introduces significant systematic uncertainties in the precise measurement of hadron structure observables via lattice QCD. The aim is to provide both a theoretical understanding and practical solutions to mitigate these effects.", "method": "A general mechanism is proposed, based on meson dominance, and it is implemented through the variational method. This approach helps in identifying which excited states are emphasized by the selection of the inserted current and kinematics conditions. The method's effectiveness is backed by numerical results and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across various hadronic channels, especially focusing on the nucleon sector.", "result": "The results show that the proposed method can predict and control the excited-state contamination effectively. It provides evidence from numerical simulations and consistency with chiral perturbation theory, demonstrating its utility in reducing systematic errors in the analysis of hadron three-point functions.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the presented mechanism offers a way to understand and manage excited-state contributions, thereby improving the accuracy of hadron structure calculations in lattice QCD. It suggests a practical approach for researchers to better control systematic uncertainties in their analyses."}}

We investigate the $DD\u03c0$ system in the $I=0$, $C=2$ sector, where the $T_{cc}^+$ appears as a pole in the $J^P = 1^+$ $DD\u03c0$ elastic scattering amplitude. The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DD\u03c0$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $\u03c0$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_\u03c0\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $D\u03c0$ two-body subsystems.

Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $\u03bc_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $\u03bc_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \\times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $\u03bba = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_\u03c0= 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \\cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $\u03bc_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the impact of isospin asymmetry on quarkonium states, particularly bottom quark correlators, using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD.

The study uses a 32^3 x 48 lattice with specified parameters for the isospin chemical potential and current strength.", "result": "The results indicate that at the highest isospin chemical potential (\u03bc_I a = 0.106), the Upsilon meson mass becomes heavier compared to its vacuum value. For lower isospin chemical potentials, the effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic, suggesting a complex interplay between isospin asymmetry and quarkonium states.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the preliminary results is that isospin asymmetry has a significant and non-trivial effect on the Upsilon meson mass, with the mass increasing at higher isospin chemical potential but exhibiting a more complicated pattern at lower values."}}
