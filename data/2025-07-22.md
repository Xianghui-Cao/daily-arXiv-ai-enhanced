Result: The result is a comprehensive guide to the subject, offering both a theoretical foundation and practical knowledge, with exercises and examples to reinforce the learning process. The notes culminate in an assessment of the current state of quantum simulation for QCD, providing insights into the computational cost and feasibility.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of developing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, highlighting its vibrancy and rapid progress as a research area within theoretical nuclear and particle physics, and the value of these lecture notes as an educational resource for the community.

Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is
the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical
predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard
Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum
computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In
particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible
first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of
equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe,
astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and
advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is
a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle
physics.
  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge
theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and
algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and
practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation
of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework,
the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some
elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are
discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing
basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory
quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is
provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current
understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is
presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and
reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.
