TL;DR: The study investigates 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models subjected to external electric fields, revealing a class of athermal states in large winding sectors. These states exhibit exotic athermal behavior and geometric fragmentation due to the emergence of new conserved quantities, with some sectors hosting fractonic excitations that have restricted mobility.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore beyond traditional thermalization scenarios in quantum statistical mechanics, specifically focusing on translationally-invariant systems like 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models that can avoid thermalization due to local constraints or higher-form symmetries.

Method: A combination of analytical and numerical methods is used to examine the 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models under the influence of external electric fields, leading to the discovery of athermal states and their characteristics.

Result: The research uncovers a class of athermal states within large winding sectors that display exotic athermal behavior and a geometric fragmentation of the system. The number of fragments scales exponentially with the linear system size, and certain sectors are found to host fractonic excitations with limited mobility.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that in 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, the application of external electric fields leads to the emergence of athermal states with novel properties, including geometric fragmentation and the presence of fractonic excitations, which have distinct dynamical behaviors compared to non-fractonic ones.

Abstract: While quantum statistical mechanics triumphs in explaining many equilibrium
phenomena, there is an increasing focus on going beyond conventional scenarios
of thermalization. Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are
either integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of
translationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited
energies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or
emergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these
investigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are
lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also
generically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter.
Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of
athermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is
subjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes
in the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an
interplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes
exotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities.
This causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical
arguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in
the linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify
sectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The
unitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different
from the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations.
