Motivated by this observation, we investigate transfer learning and show that fine-tuning models pretrained at a single value of $\u03ba$ can reduce training time compared with training from a Gaussian field. In addition, inspired by single-site and cluster Monte Carlo updates, we introduce single-site and block Metropolis--Hastings (MH) updates on top of VAN proposals. These MH corrections systematically reduce the residual bias of pure VAN sampling in the parameter range we study, while maintaining high sampling efficiency in terms of the effective sample size (ESS).
