TL;DR: The study investigates S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD, revealing overall attraction in both spin-1 and spin-2 channels, with no dibaryon bound state. The potentials are decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components, and the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability is discussed.

Motivation: To understand the S-wave interactions between the nucleon and the triply charmed Omega baryon, as well as to investigate the charm quark mass dependence of the potential and the influence of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability on such systems.

Method: (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass on a specific lattice volume, employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method to extract the N-$\Omega_{\\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 and spin-2 channels, and further decomposing these potentials into spin-independent and spin-dependent parts.

Result: Overall attraction was found in both the $^3\\mathrm{S}_1$ and $^5\\mathrm{S}_2$ channels, but no dibaryon bound state was indicated. The spin-independent potential has a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction in the spin-1 channel and repulsion in the spin-2 channel. The charm quark mass dependence of the potential was also explored.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon, emphasizing the importance of the heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability effect due to soft-gluon exchange, and establishes a basis for understanding the charm quark mass dependence of the N-$\Omega_{\\rm ccc}$ potential.

Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply
charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD
with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume
$\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a
relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the
time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in
the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are
extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering
parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and
$r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the
$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} =
2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel,
indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are
further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The
spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range
attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent
potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2)
channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and
$N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided,
emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from
soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm
quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated
as well.
