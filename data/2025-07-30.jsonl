Horowitz"], "title": "The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice", "comment": "17 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian\nSU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase.\nFor the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored\nand we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical\nbox is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless\nnon-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir\npotential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size\nis fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the\nwalls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various\nmethods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating\nthe boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a\ndeconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is\nconsistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a\nboundary induced deconfined phase."}

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called\nthe Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with\ntriad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect\nto the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy\nand other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both\nthe ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve\nperformance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system."}
