First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have\nmostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the\nadvent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to\nbridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one\nspatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time\nstring dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.\nIn the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through\nsharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a\ndistinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a\n\\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from\nresonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball\nloops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with\ndistinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover\nrepresentation-dependent tension-reduction resonances.
