Motivation: To investigate the properties of the quantum Ising model on hyperbolic lattices, particularly its phase transitions and the behavior of boundary-boundary correlations and entanglement in an AdS background.

Method: Utilizes Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) along with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to find the ground state and analyze the bulk phase diagram, entanglement, and scrambling behavior via Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs).

Result: Identified disordered and ordered phases with a phase transition between them; observed power-law scaling of boundary-boundary spin correlations in the disordered phase; found logarithmic dependence of entanglement entropy at the critical point and linear scaling away from it, while the full system shows volume law scaling; measured OTOCs to characterize scrambling.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into the quantum Ising model's behavior on hyperbolic lattices, including the nature of phase transitions, correlation functions, and entanglement properties, as well as the scrambling dynamics within the context of an AdS spacetime.

Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

TL;DR: This paper provides updated results for the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, using ETMC's physical point ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass fermions. It includes continuum extrapolations for strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and preliminary findings for light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a single lattice spacing.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, particularly focusing on the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution, which is one of the least well-known components in the Standard Model calculation.

Method: The method involves using lattice QCD simulations with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass fermions from ETMC at the physical pion mass. The researchers perform continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected HLbL contributions and also provide an analysis of the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a fixed lattice spacing.

Result: The result is an updated estimate of the HLbL contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, with improved precision due to the inclusion of the continuum limit for the strange- and charm-quark connected diagrams, as well as the initial results for the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the new calculations provide a more accurate determination of the HLbL contribution to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, contributing to the reduction of the theoretical uncertainty and potentially helping to resolve the current discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values.

Abstract: We present updated results for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The calculations are based on ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles at the physical point. We perform continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and report on our results for the light-quark connected and light-quark 2+2 disconnected contributions at one lattice spacing.
