Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \\ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews the current understanding of the QCD phase diagram through various theoretical approaches and recent lattice results, with a focus on reconstructing the full phase diagram for physical QCD and implications for neutron star cores.", "motivation": "The motivation is to synthesize the latest advancements in lattice techniques and their application to exploring new aspects of the QCD phase diagram, particularly for physical QCD (N_f=1+1+1), and to understand the implications for the matter in neutron star cores.", "method": "The method involves reviewing existing literature on the QCD phase diagram obtained from lattice calculations, effective field theories, and chiral models, and using this information to infer the characteristics of the full phase diagram for physical QCD.", "result": "The result is an updated view of the QCD phase diagram, including precise sections for N_f=2+1, and insights into the reconstruction of the phase diagram for physical QCD.
