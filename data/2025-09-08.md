Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the determination of the fourth Mellin moment of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) in quenched QCD, with specific results for the second and fourth moments given at a renormalization scale of 2 GeV.

Motivation: To provide essential non-perturbative input for high-energy exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics by determining the pion LCDA's continuum limit.

Method: The study uses quenched QCD with quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 550 MeV, and calculates the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA, reporting uncertainties from both statistical/systematic analysis and Wilson coefficients accuracy.

Result: The second and fourth Mellin moments are found to be $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4 \rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ respectively, with the first error being the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty and the second error from the next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. The results are provided in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.

Conclusion: The determined Mellin moments of the pion LCDA contribute to the understanding of high-energy exclusive processes and provide a benchmark for future studies in lattice QCD.

Abstract: The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential
non-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in
quantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of
the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using
quark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 550$ MeV. This
calculation finds $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4
\rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined
statistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second
indicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to
next-to-leading order. These results are presented in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the 3+1 D staggered fermion Hamiltonian
possesses, in addition to the conserved charge $Q_0$ that generates the vector
$\mathrm{U}(1)_V$ transformation, conserved charges $Q_F$ that generate the
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ transformations in the continuum limit, acting
simultaneously on left- and right-handed Weyl fermions in opposite directions.
Each conserved charge $Q_F$ can be regarded as the generator of a
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(2)_R \times
\mathrm{U}(1)_A$. One of these lattice charges satisfies the Onsager algebra.
On the lattice, the charges $Q_F$ do not commute with $Q_0$, and no symmetric
mass term exists that commutes with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$. This signals the
presence of a mixed anomaly. Remarkably, however, in the continuum limit, a
symmetric mass term commuting with both $Q_0$ and $Q_F$ can be constructed. %
This implies that the non-trivial lattice anomaly becomes a trivial anomaly in
the continuum QFT. This means that the mixed anomaly that is nontrivial on the
lattice becomes trivial in the IR QFT obtained in the continuum limit, which is
consistent with the analysis of the Ward--Takahashi (WT) identity on the
lattice. Indeed, by evaluating this identity associated with the
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ transformation on the lattice, we confirm that
$\mathrm{U}(1)_F$ symmetry is exactly conserved.
