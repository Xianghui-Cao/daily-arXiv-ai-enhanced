Due to color confinement, these correlators decay exponentially at large spatial distances, a behavior crucial for computing momentum-space Fourier transformations with controlled errors from lattice QCD data. Using heavy-quark effective theory reduction, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and heavy-flavor spectra, we determine the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors and relate the expansion parameters to binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. We demonstrate the results through two-loop calculations in $φ^3$ theory and from the perspective of locality and analyticity. We also study the impact of the asymptotic analysis on realistic lattice QCD data and demonstrate reliable error estimates."}

To this end we use a recently developed method that allows one to modify an existing perturbative calculation, like the one for $c_\\mathrm{SW}^{(1)}$, to include stout smearing or Wilson flow at arbitrary stout parameters ($\\varrho$, $n_\\mathrm{stout}$) or flow times $t/a^2$, respectively. Our results indicate that already a small amount of smoothing makes the perturbative series well behaved, suggesting that a non-perturbatively determined $c_\\mathrm{SW}$ might be close to its one-loop value for couplings $g_0^2\\simeq 1$."}

We achieve this through nonperturbative renormalization of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, including its trace, in a gradient-flow scheme, followed by continuum extrapolations, two-loop matching to the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, and zero-flow-time extrapolations. These ingredients enable a direct and simultaneous verification, in a common renormalization scheme and scale, of multiple energy-density-based and trace-based mass decomposition sum rules proposed in the literature. We demonstrate the framework for the $η_c$ and $J/ψ$ charmonia using three fine lattice spacings with a physical strange-quark and near-physical up- and down-quark masses. We present the first lattice-QCD results for the gravitational form factor $\\bar{C}$. We find sizable gluonic contributions to charmonia masses at the hadronic scale, $\\sim 15\\%$ in the Lorcé and Metz-Pasquini-Rodini decompositions. The trace-anomaly contribution in the Ji sum rule is $\\sim 6\\%$, while the gluonic component of the trace anomaly in the Hatta-Rajan-Tanaka sum rule is $\\sim 35\\%$. The method is general and can be straightforwardly adopted for lattice-QCD calculations of mass and spin decompositions as well as gravitational form factors of other hadrons and nuclei."}

This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves."}
