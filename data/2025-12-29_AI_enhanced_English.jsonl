We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $\u03b2= 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the two-body color density matrix $\u03c1$ of static quarks, and investigate the dependence of color correlations on the quarks' spatial configuration. As a result, we find that the color correlations depend on the minimal path length along a flux tube which connects two quarks under consideration. The color correlation between quarks quenches because of color leak into the gluon field (flux tube) and finally approaches the random color configuration in the large distance limit. We find a ``universality'' in the flux-tube path length dependence of the color leak for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q ground-state systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates color correlations between static quarks in 3Q and 4Q multiquark systems at zero temperature using lattice QCD calculations.

The total action is local on $\u039b$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.\n  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,\u03a6)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $\u039b$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations; in particular, in $d=4$ we recover the standard one-loop $\u03b2$-function in a scalar $\u03c6^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report $d=2$ proof-of-concept simulations showing a well-behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "A dynamical-lattice regulator (DLR) for Euclidean quantum field theories is introduced, where the embedding of a hypercubic graph into real space is treated as a dynamical field. The DLR ensures exact covariance under the global Euclidean group and aims to restore symmetry through local twisting of the embedding.

Preliminary 2D simulations show improved behavior over fixed lattices.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a new lattice regularization scheme, the DLR, which maintains exact Euclidean symmetry at any lattice spacing and reduces cutoff artifacts by allowing the lattice to dynamically twist locally. This is expected to improve upon traditional fixed-lattice methods by providing a more natural way to handle geometric fluctuations and potentially leading to better numerical results in lattice field theory simulations.", "method": "The method involves promoting the embedding of a hypercubic graph into a dynamical field, with the total action being local, gauge invariant, and dependent only on Euclidean invariants.

In 2D, the simulations show a well-behaved geometry sector and a significant reduction in axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts compared to a fixed lattice setup.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the DLR provides a promising approach for lattice field theories, maintaining exact Euclidean symmetry and showing potential for reducing lattice artifacts. The theoretical framework is supported by preliminary simulation results, indicating that the DLR could be a valuable tool for future lattice field theory studies, especially in higher dimensions."}}
