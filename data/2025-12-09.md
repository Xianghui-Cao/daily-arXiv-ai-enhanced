### [1] [HoloNet: Toward a Unified Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Framework of QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06044)
*Hong-An Zeng,Lingxiao Wang,Mei Huang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers developed HoloNet, a neural network that combines Lattice QCD thermodynamics with holographic EMD theory, learning directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data to reproduce equations of state and predict the QCD phase diagram, including the critical end point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a unified and data-driven approach for describing QCD thermodynamics using holographic principles, which can accurately model the equation of state and baryon number fluctuations, and extend these models to finite density conditions.

Method: HoloNet, a neural-network framework, learns the metric profile and gauge-dilaton coupling directly from LQCD data, then uses these learned functions within the EMD equations to generate a holographic description of QCD. This method allows for the prediction of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical end point (CEP).

Result: The results show that HoloNet can reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high accuracy. The reconstructed potential and coupling are consistent with those from holographic renormalization, indicating that HoloNet successfully bridges different holographic models.

Conclusion: HoloNet provides a novel, fully data-driven way to describe QCD thermodynamics through holography, capable of extending to finite density and predicting the QCD phase diagram, including the CEP, while maintaining consistency with established holographic models.

Abstract: We propose HoloNet, a neural-network framework that unifies lattice QCD(LQCD) thermodynamics and holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory within a data-to-holography pipeline. Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(φ)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $μ=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(φ)$ and coupling $f(φ)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models.

### [2] [Pion and Kaon PDFs from Lattice QCD with Complementary Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06121)
*Joshua Miller,Joseph Torsiello,Isaac Anderson,Krzysztof Cichy,Martha Constantinou,Joseph Delmar,Sarah Lampreich*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and kaon, using two complementary frameworks (LaMET and SDF) to match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts. The study also explores SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects and parametrizes the momentum dependence for LaMET to obtain infinite-momentum PDFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a detailed understanding of the quark structure within pions and kaons by calculating their unpolarized quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) from first principles, as well as to test different methodologies for matching lattice QCD results with light-cone physics, and to explore SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects.

Method: The method involves lattice-QCD calculations on an ensemble with two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark, using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The authors calculate matrix elements for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line at various hadron boost levels. They employ both large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and short-distance factorization (SDF) to match the lattice QCD results to the light-cone counterparts and extract standard and valence quark PDFs.

Result: The results include the calculated unpolarized quark PDFs for the pion and kaon, along with the exploration of SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. Additionally, the parametrization of the momentum dependence for LaMET allows for the determination of infinite-momentum PDFs, providing insights into the quark structure at high energies.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the lattice-QCD approach, combined with LaMET and SDF, successfully provides a detailed description of the quark PDFs for the pion and kaon, and offers a means to investigate SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. The work also highlights the importance of comparing different theoretical approaches to understand the systematic uncertainties in the extraction of PDFs.

Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles lattice-QCD calculation of the unpolarized quark PDF for the pion and the kaon. The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs.

### [3] [A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06762)
*Shang-Wei Li,Kai-Wei Huang,Chien-Ting Chen,Fu-Jiun Jiang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses a supervised neural network (MLP) to accurately identify the critical temperatures of 2D antiferromagnetic q-state Potts models, indicating that q=3 is critical only at zero temperature, and q=4,5,6 remain disordered at all temperatures. The MLP, trained with artificial staggered configurations, has potential for detecting untypical critical phenomena in other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the critical phenomena of 2D antiferromagnetic q-state Potts models on a square lattice using a supervised neural network, and to assess the ability of the trained MLP to detect the critical behavior without direct training on the specific models.

Method: A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one input, one hidden, and one output layer was trained using two artificially created stagger-like configurations. The method does not require any inputs from the models under investigation, yet it aims to correctly predict their critical temperatures and phase transition behaviors.

Result: The MLP successfully identified the critical temperatures of the 2D antiferromagnetic q-state Potts models, finding that q=3 is critical only at zero temperature, while q=4,5,6 models do not order at any finite temperature. This result aligns with previous findings where the same approach was used for the 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions.

Conclusion: The neural network approach demonstrated its capability to discern critical phenomena of 2D antiferromagnetic Potts models without being specifically trained on them, suggesting its potential for application to other models with unusual critical behavior.

Abstract: The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.

### [4] [Polyakov loop model with exact static quark determinant in the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit: SU(N) case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07026)
*Sergii Voloshyn*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents an exact solution for the d-dimensional SU(N) Polyakov loop model at finite temperature and non-zero baryon chemical potential, using a mean-field approximation that becomes exact in the large-N, large-Nf limit. The authors solve a deformed unitary matrix model to compute the free energy, expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density, and they describe the phase diagram of the model, showing how it differs from the U(N) model and extends the three-phase structure known from 1D QCD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to construct an exact solution for the d-dimensional SU(N) Polyakov loop model with the static quark determinant, which allows for a deeper understanding of QCD-like theories at finite temperature and non-zero baryon chemical potential. This is important for exploring the phase structure of such theories, especially in the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit.

Method: The method involves employing a mean-field approximation that becomes exact in the joint large-N, large-Nf limit, and reducing the core of the Polyakov loop model to a deformed unitary matrix model. The authors then solve this model analytically to obtain various physical quantities of interest, including the free energy, expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density.

Result: The results include the computation of the free energy and its derivatives, the expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density. The authors also provide a detailed description of the phase diagram, illustrating the differences between the SU(N) and U(N) models and extending the three-phase structure known from one-dimensional QCD to non-zero coupling.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by solving the deformed unitary matrix model, the authors are able to present a comprehensive analysis of the d-dimensional SU(N) Polyakov loop model's phase structure and thermodynamic properties, providing new insights into QCD-like theories at finite temperature and non-zero baryon chemical potential.

Abstract: We construct an exact solution of the $d$-dimensional $SU(N)$ Polyakov loop model with the exact static quark determinant at finite temperature and non-zero baryon chemical potential in the 't~Hooft--Veneziano limit. In the joint large-$N$, large-$N_f$ limit with fixed ratio $κ= N_f/N$, the mean-field approximation becomes exact, and the core of the Polyakov loop model reduces to a deformed unitary matrix model, which we solve analytically. In particular, we compute the free energy and its derivatives, the expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density, and we describe the phase diagram of the model in detail. We show how the $SU(N)$ case differs from the corresponding $U(N)$ model and how the three-phase structure known from one-dimensional QCD at finite density extends to non-zero coupling.
