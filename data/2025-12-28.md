TL;DR: The study explores the quantum Ising model in (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using MPS and MPOs, finding a phase transition between disordered and ordered phases. It also examines the boundary-boundary spin correlation, entanglement entropy, and OTOCs to understand the system's behavior.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the quantum Ising model in a (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, which involves exploring the bulk phase diagram, boundary-boundary correlations, entanglement entropy, and scrambling dynamics via OTOCs.

Method: The researchers employed Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) on hyperbolic lattices with coordination number seven, and used the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to find the ground state of the model. They also traced out the bulk indices to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory and measured Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs).

Result: The results include the identification of disordered and ordered phases with a phase transition, power law scaling of the boundary-boundary spin correlation function, logarithmic dependence of entanglement entropy at the critical point, volume law scaling of the full system, and an exploration of the scrambling behavior through OTOCs.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that the quantum Ising model in (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space exhibits distinct phases and critical behavior, with the entanglement properties and scrambling dynamics providing insights into the nature of the underlying quantum system.

Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

TL;DR: This paper updates the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment using ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles, with continuum extrapolations for strange- and charm-quark contributions and results for light-quark contributions at one lattice spacing.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, which is a key quantity in testing the Standard Model of particle physics, by refining the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution that is known to be challenging to calculate precisely.

Method: The authors use lattice QCD simulations with ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass fermions at the physical quark masses. They perform calculations for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and conduct continuum extrapolations. Additionally, they report on the light-quark connected and 2+2 disconnected contributions at a single lattice spacing.

Result: The study provides updated values for the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, including continuum-extrapolated results for the strange- and charm-quark parts and preliminary results for the light-quark contributions at one lattice spacing.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the ongoing effort to reduce the uncertainty in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the muon g-2, which is essential for the precision tests of the Standard Model. The new results bring us closer to a more accurate determination of this important observable.

Abstract: We present updated results for the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The calculations are based on ETMC's $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson-clover twisted-mass ensembles at the physical point. We perform continuum extrapolations for the strange- and charm-quark connected contributions and report on our results for the light-quark connected and light-quark 2+2 disconnected contributions at one lattice spacing.
