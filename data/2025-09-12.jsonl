First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have\nmostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the\nadvent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to\nbridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one\nspatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time\nstring dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.\nIn the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through\nsharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a\ndistinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a\n\\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from\nresonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball\nloops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with\ndistinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover\nrepresentation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a\nguide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs."}

However, its application to off-shell partons has been\nlargely restricted to the Landau gauge, as achieving high-precision $\\xi$-gauge\nfixing on the lattice poses significant challenges. Motivated by a universal\npower-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing\nprecision in the Landau gauge, we propose an empirical precision extrapolation\nmethod to approximate high-precision $\\xi$-gauge fixing. By properly defining\nthe bare gauge coupling and then the effective $\\xi$, we validate our\n$\\xi$-gauge fixing procedure by successfully reproducing the $\\xi$-dependent\nRI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2\\%\nlevel, up to $\\xi \\sim 1$."}
