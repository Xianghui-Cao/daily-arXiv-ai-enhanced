The calculation is done on ensembles at three different lattice spacings $a=\\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\\}$ fm. By employing distillation + momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\u03bc$ under the 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations.

The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties.
