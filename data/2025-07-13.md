Motivation: To investigate the non-perturbative aspects of the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which has an enlarged scalar spectrum and the potential for spontaneous global symmetry breaking, as well as to understand the behavior of additional scalar states and the electroweak phase transition.

Method: Non-perturbative lattice simulations are used to study the occurrence of spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry, the spectrum, and the running of the gauge coupling at weak quartic couplings. The study is performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300 to 600 GeV, and bare couplings are tuned to maintain a line of constant standard model physics.

Result: Spontaneous breaking of the custodial symmetry is observed in a region of the parameter space. The lower bound for the masses of additional scalar states is found to be below the $W$ boson mass and independent of the cutoff. The finite temperature electroweak transition shows a smooth crossover behavior along the line of constant standard model physics.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the non-perturbative regime of the custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, indicating that the presence of additional Higgs doublets can lead to new scalar states with masses potentially lighter than the $W$ boson, and the electroweak phase transition is characterized by a smooth crossover.

Abstract: The $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, which shares the same
global-symmetry properties with the standard model, is studied
non-perturbatively on the lattice. The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the
scalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the
global symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous
breaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the
model. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling
are examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial
symmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300
to 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning
bare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$
bosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of
the $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are
explored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated
lower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and
independent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak
transition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing
properties of a smooth crossover behavior.
