Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist\nparameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\\ll\\kappa_c $) and\ninverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions\nstabilize the $(\\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal\ntwist satisfying $k/\\sqrt{N} < 1/9$, where the $(\\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is\nspontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also\nsuggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to\n$SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the\nadjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially\nreduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^1$ and study\nthe theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions.\nNumerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and\n$\\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with\nperiodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined)\nphase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining\ntransition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic\nadjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency\nchecks supporting these findings."}

The\n$T_{cc}^+$ state was observed as a peak just bellow the $DD^*$ threshold by\nLHCb Collaboration, while the $T_{bb}^-$ state is a theoretically predicted\ntetraquark state having heavier quark flavors $bb\\bar u \\bar d$. L\\\"uscher's\nfinite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the\nscattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several\nstudies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to\ndetermine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$\nsystem. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the\n$BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the\n$DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types\nof partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted\nboundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any\nmomentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to\neasily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$-\nand $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1\nflavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used. For\ncharm and bottom quarks, the relativistic heavy quark action is adopted to\nreduce the lattice discretization artifacts due to the heavy quark mass. We\ndiscuss the emergence of a shallow bound state with a binding energy of\n$\\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV at the physical pion mass in the $BB^*$ system, which\nhas the quantum number $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$."}

We employ $N_\\mathrm{f}$=2+1+1 twisted mass clover-improved\nfermions with quark masses tuned to their physical values. Three ensembles with\nlattice spacings of $a$=0.080 fm, 0.068 fm, and 0.057 fm, and approximately the\nsame physical volume allow us to obtain the continuum limit directly at the\nphysical pion mass. For each ensemble, we use several values of the sink-source\ntime separation, ranging from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm, to allow for a thorough\nanalysis of excited state effects via multi-state fits. The disconnected\ncontributions are also analyzed using high statistics combined with techniques\nto mitigate stochastic noise in the estimation of the fermion loop. These\ntechniques include low-mode deflation, dilution in the color and spin\ncomponents, and hierarchical probing. We study the momentum transfer dependence\nof the form factors using the $z$-expansion and dipole Ans\\\"atze, thereby\nenabling the extraction of the electric and magnetic radii and the magnetic\nmoments, as well as the Zemach and Friar radii in the continuum limit.
