TL;DR: A new numerical algorithm for the modified Lüscher zeta-function is introduced, which shows minimal impact from truncating higher partial waves. The paper also discusses regularization and renormalization, presenting a scheme that yields naturally sized effective range expansion parameters across all partial waves.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop an efficient numerical algorithm for calculating the modified Lüscher zeta-function in scenarios involving long-range forces, while addressing the issues of truncation, regularization, and renormalization that arise with the standard Lüscher approach.

Method: The method involves using the formalism from a referenced study to analyze synthetic data on finite-volume energy levels in a simplified model. The authors then discuss the regularization and renormalization of the modified Lüscher zeta-function, and propose a new renormalization scheme to obtain natural-sized effective range parameters.

Result: The results show that truncating higher partial waves has little effect on the final outcome when using the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the new renormalization scheme successfully produces effective range expansion parameters of natural size for all partial waves, even under cutoff regularization.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the newly developed numerical algorithm and renormalization scheme provide a robust and accurate method for calculating the modified Lüscher zeta-function, with improved handling of truncation and regularization issues compared to the traditional Lüscher approach.

Abstract: An efficient numerical algoritm is proposed for the calculation of the
modified L\"uscher zeta-function in the presence of a long-range force. Using
the formalism developed in Ref.~\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of
synthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is
demonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\"uscher approach, the
truncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final
result. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified
L\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising
within the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization
scheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range
expansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.
