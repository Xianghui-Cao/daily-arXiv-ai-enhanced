Ciavarella", "Jad C. Halimeh", "Christian W. Bauer"], "title": "Large Nc Truncations for SU(Nc) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory with Fermions", "comment": "37 pages, 33 figures, 5 appendices", "summary": "Quantum simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) require a representation of gauge fields and fermions on the finitely many degrees of freedom available on a quantum computer. We introduce a truncation of lattice QCD coupled to staggered fermions that includes (i) a local Krylov truncation that generates allowed basis states; (ii) a maximum allowed electric energy per link; (iii) a limit on the number of fermions per site; and (iv) a truncation in the large N_c scaling of Hamiltonian matrix elements. Explicit truncated Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices are given, and numerical simulations of string-breaking dynamics are performed.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a truncation method for lattice QCD coupled with staggered fermions, which is designed to be suitable for quantum simulations on a quantum computer. It includes several constraints and truncations, and provides explicit Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices, along with numerical simulations of string-breaking dynamics.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a practical approach to simulate Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on a quantum computer, by effectively representing gauge fields and fermions within the limited degrees of freedom available in such a system.", "method": "The authors propose a truncation scheme that comprises local Krylov truncation, a cap on the electric energy per link, a limit on the number of fermions per site, and a truncation according to the large N_c scaling of the Hamiltonian matrix elements. They provide explicit Hamiltonians for one- and two-dimensional lattices and perform numerical simulations to study string-breaking dynamics.", "result": "The result is a set of truncated Hamiltonians for 1+1D and 2+1D lattices, and the numerical simulations demonstrate the dynamics of string breaking under the proposed truncation scheme.", "conclusion": "The conclusion would likely emphasize the effectiveness of the truncation method in simulating QCD on a quantum computer, and its potential for further studies in high-energy physics. The simulations suggest that the method can capture the essential features of QCD, including string-breaking phenomena, within the constraints of a quantum computing environment."}}

Kronfeld", "Julian Mayer-Steudte"], "title": "Wilson loops with neural networks", "comment": "23 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "Wilson loops are essential objects in QCD and have been pivotal in scale setting and demonstrating confinement. Various generalizations are crucial for computations needed in effective field theories. In lattice gauge theory, Wilson loop calculations face challenges, including excited-state contamination at short times and the signal-to-noise ratio issue at longer times. To address these problems, we develop a new method by using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair. We construct gauge-equivariant layers for the network and train it to find the ground state of the system. The trained network itself is then treated as our new observable for the inference. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the signal compared to traditional Wilson loops, performing as well as Coulomb-gauge Wilson-line correlators while maintaining gauge invariance. Additionally, we present an example where the optimized ground state is used to measure the static force directly, as well as another example combining this method with the multilevel algorithm. Finally, we extend the formalism to find excited-state interpolators for static quark-antiquark systems. To our knowledge, this work is the first study of neural networks with a physically motivated loss function for Wilson loops.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new method using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for static quark-antiquark pairs in Wilson loop calculations, improving the signal and addressing challenges such as excited-state contamination and signal-to-noise ratio issues.

A more efficient and accurate approach is needed to improve these calculations.", "method": "The authors developed a method that employs neural networks to create interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair.

It also enables direct measurement of the static force and can be integrated with the multilevel algorithm. Furthermore, the method was extended to find excited-state interpolators for static quark-antiquark systems.", "conclusion": "This work introduces a novel use of neural networks with a physically motivated loss function for Wilson loops, which effectively addresses the computational challenges in lattice gauge theory and provides a robust alternative to existing methods."}}
