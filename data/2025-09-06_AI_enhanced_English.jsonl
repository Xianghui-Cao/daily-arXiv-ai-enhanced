We use a $24^3\\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an\ninverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\\infty$-based formalism.\nOur implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed\ndiagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision\non the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a\ndestructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the\ndecay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The\nprecision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical\ncontribution of the $\\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are\ntested and compared.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude for the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, with 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part. It also determines a destructive interference between long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude.", "motivation": "The motivation is to compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange contribution to the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, which has not been accurately determined before, especially the interference pattern with the short-distance contributions.", "method": "The method involves using a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble in lattice QCD at an inverse lattice spacing of 1.023 GeV, along with a QED$_\\infty$-based formalism. The researchers detail their implementation strategies for all five non-SU(3)-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies.", "result": "The result is a 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the long-distance amplitude, and the determination of a destructive interference with the short-distance parts. The accuracy is constrained by the reconstruction of the physical contribution of the $\\eta$ intermediate state, with various strategies being tested and compared.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the study provides a significant advancement in understanding the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, particularly in terms of the long-distance effects and their interference with the short-distance contributions, though the precision is currently limited by the treatment of the $\\eta$ intermediate state."}}
