### [1] [Critical coupling in $φ_2^4$ theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16536)
*Stephan Durr,Tolga S. H. Kiel*

Main category: hep-lat

Motivation: The motivation is to study the phase transition from the symmetric to the broken phase in the $φ^4$ theory by determining the critical bare mass and to provide a precise value for the universal quantity $f_\mathrm{c}$.

Method: The method involves using lattice regularization to calculate the critical bare mass for various self-couplings, transitioning to infinite volume, and applying a universal scheme with renormalized parameters to find the limit that defines $f_\mathrm{c}$.

Result: The result is the determination of the (negative) critical bare mass for different self-couplings and the calculation of the universal quantity $f_\mathrm{c}$ with a final value of $11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are also provided.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the researchers have successfully determined the critical bare mass for the phase transition in the $φ^4$ theory and calculated the universal quantity $f_\mathrm{c}$, contributing to the understanding of the system's behavior at the phase transition point.

Abstract: We consider $φ^4$ theory with $φ(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hatλ$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hatμ_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hatλ)$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hatλ\to0}\hatλ/\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.

### [2] [Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16863)
*Thomas Appelquist,James Ingoldby,Maurizio Piai*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper uses dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) to analyze lattice data from gauge theories, distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories. It finds that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions likely confines, while the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion exhibits infrared conformal behavior.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a diagnostic tool using dEFT to distinguish between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories in gauge theories close to the lower edge of the conformal window, which can help in understanding the phase structure of these theories.

Method: The authors use dEFT to fit and analyze two sets of existing lattice data. One set is for an $SU(3)$ gauge theory with 8 Dirac fermions, and the other is for an $SU(2)$ gauge theory with 1 adjoint fermion. The analysis includes fitting the lattice data to determine whether the theories exhibit confinement or infrared conformality.

Result: The analysis indicates that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions is more likely to be confining, whereas the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion shows signs of infrared conformal behavior. The results suggest that dEFT can serve as a useful tool for diagnosing the nature of the theories.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that dEFT is a viable diagnostic tool for distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories. The authors also propose further lattice measurements and refinements to the dEFT analysis to test and strengthen the framework.

Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.
