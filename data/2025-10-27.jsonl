We\nstudy a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct\nPDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian\nprocesses serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and\nconstraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide\nrange of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We\nquantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler\ndivergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of\nthe method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric\napproach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and\nreduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses."}

The\ndevelopment of viable candidates for quantum gravity allows now to investigate\nthese ideas. Analytic methods show that the description of geons needs to be\nbased on composite operators made out of the graviton field. We present results\nfrom a numerical investigation into this idea using causal dynamical\ntriangulations, an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity\nbased on general relativity, and accessible in lattice-gauge-theory-like\nsimulations. Our results suggest an interesting dependence on cosmological time\nand other unexpected features. Finally, we extend the analytic part of the\nsetting to a supergravity scenario. This provides hints which, if confirmed,\ncould explain why supersymmetry may in a realistic universe in principle not be\nobservable at low (collider) energy scales."}
