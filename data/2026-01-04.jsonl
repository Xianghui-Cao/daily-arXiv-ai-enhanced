The calculation is done on ensembles at three different lattice spacings $a=\\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\\}$ fm. By employing distillation + momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^μ$ under the 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented with the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^μ$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $ΔG$ is found to be $ΔG = 0.231(17)^{\\mathrm{sta.}}(33)^{\\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scale $μ^2=10\\ \\mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(7)\\%$ of the proton spin."}

Sharpe"], "title": "Implementing the three-neutron quantization condition", "comment": "50 pages including references, 8 figures", "summary": "We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions."}

Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices, we find evidence for traditional second-order critical points separating the first two and the latter two phases. Remarkably, these critical points appear to merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, giving rise to the recently discovered direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases."}
