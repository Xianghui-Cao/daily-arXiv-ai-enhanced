### [1] [Renormalization Group Approach to Confinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10658)
*Gerrit Schierholz*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenge of evolving QCD theory from a perturbative to a confining regime, using gradient flow and renormalization group transformations. It focuses on the running coupling αS(μ) and demonstrates that confinement can be inferred from it, with the gluon condensate being scale-invariant and leading to an infrared fixed point, indicating that homogeneous vacuum fields are key to confinement. Numerical simulations support these analytical findings.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for calculating aspects of confinement in QCD, which is currently not possible analytically, and to provide a framework that could potentially prove confinement. The paper aims to bridge the gap between the perturbative and long-distance confining regimes of the theory.

Method: The method involves the use of gradient flow and renormalization group transformations to evolve the theory. The analysis centers on the running coupling αS(μ) and the role of the gluon condensate, which is shown to be scale-invariant, reflecting self-similar behavior across different scales. An analytical expression for αS(μ) is derived, leading to an infrared fixed point consistent with the concept of infrared slavery.

Result: The result is the derivation of αS(μ) ≈ ΛS^2/μ^2, which evolves to the infrared fixed point 1/αS = 0, in line with the idea of infrared slavery. This suggests that the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, such as condensates, is a critical factor for confinement, a feature shared by QCD and other models. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the scale invariance of the gluon condensate and the derived behavior of the running coupling αS(μ) indicate that confinement in QCD is driven by the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields. This finding is supported by both analytical derivations and numerical simulations, suggesting a universal mechanism for confinement in QCD and similar theories.

Abstract: While we have several complementary models of confinement, some of which are
phenomenologically appealing, we do not have the ability to calculate
analytically even simple aspects of confinement, let alone have a framework to
eventually prove confinement. The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory
from the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is
generally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient
flow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The
primary focus is on the running coupling $\alpha_S(\mu)$, from which
confinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon
condensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across
different scales. Building on that, we derive $\alpha_S(\mu) \simeq
\Lambda_S^2/\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\alpha_S = 0$
in accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor
is the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which
is a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical
statements are supported by numerical simulations.

### [2] [Using orthogonal projectors in multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo for trace estimation in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11424)
*Andreas Frommer,Jose Jimenez-Merchan,Francesco Knechtli,Tomasz Korzec,Gustavo Ramirez-Hidalgo*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method for stochastic trace estimation in lattice QCD is introduced, showing significant variance reductions and cost savings, particularly for connected pseudoscalar correlators and the trace of the Dirac operator's inverse, but not for disconnected fermion loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of stochastic trace estimation in lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) by introducing a new method that employs orthogonal projections, aiming to reduce the variance and computational cost compared to existing methods.

Method: The authors introduce a multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method based on orthogonal projections. This method is an extension of a previously proposed oblique decomposition technique. The performance of the new method is evaluated through three specific problems: the calculation of the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the trace of the inverse of the full Dirac operator, and the evaluation of disconnected fermion loops.

Result: For the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the method achieves up to 30 times cost savings at large time separations, surpassing both the plain Hutchinson's estimator and the oblique formulation. In the case of the trace of the inverse of the Dirac operator, the variance reductions are less pronounced but still systematic, with greater impact on systems with poorer conditioning. However, there was no improvement observed for disconnected fermion loops, as their variance is primarily due to local same-slice contributions, which are not addressed by the new decomposition.

Conclusion: The new multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method with orthogonal projections is effective in reducing variance and achieving cost savings for certain types of calculations in lattice QCD, such as the connected pseudoscalar correlator and the trace of the Dirac operator's inverse. It does not, however, provide benefits for disconnected fermion loops, where the variance is controlled by different factors.

Abstract: We introduce a multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method for stochastic trace
estimation in lattice QCD based on orthogonal projections. This formulation
extends the previously proposed oblique decomposition and it is assessed on
three representative problems: the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the trace
of the full Dirac operator's inverse $\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, and disconnected
fermion loops. For the connected correlator, variance reductions grow
systematically with the time separation and lead to cost savings of up to a
factor of 30 at large separations, outperforming both the plain Hutchinson's
estimator and the oblique formulation. For $\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, reductions
are more modest but remain systematic, with stronger effects on more
ill-conditioned systems. Disconnected loops show no improvement, since their
variance is dominated by local same-slice contributions not targeted by the
decomposition.

### [3] [The phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11437)
*Shang-Wei Li,Yuan-Heng Tseng,Fu-Jiun Jiang*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses Monte Carlo simulations to analyze phase transitions in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, finding second-order phase transitions for certain $J_2/|J_1|$ values and no transition for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.3$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of phase transitions in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on a honeycomb lattice with varying ratios of next-to-nearest neighbor coupling ($J_2$) to nearest-neighbor coupling ($J_1$).

Method: Non-perturbative first principle Monte Carlo simulations were employed to study the phase transitions for different values of $J_2/|J_1|$. The analysis was limited by extremely large autocorrelation or equilibrium times for $J_2/|J_1|$ in the range (0.24, 0.3).

Result: Second-order phase transitions belonging to the 2D Ising universality class were found for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24$. Evidence for second-order phase transitions was also found for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8, 1.0$. No phase transition was indicated for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.3$. Data could not be obtained for $J_2/|J_1|$ in the range (0.24, 0.3) due to computational constraints.

Conclusion: The research provides a detailed phase diagram for the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, confirming second-order phase transitions for specific $J_2/|J_1|$ ratios and suggesting that a phase transition is unlikely for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.3$, with some regions remaining unexplored due to technical limitations.

Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on
the honeycomb lattice using the non-perturbative first principle Monte Carlo
simulations. Here $J_1 < 0$ and $J_2 > 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest
couplings, respectively. In particular, the values of $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22,
0.23, 0.24, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8,$ and 1.0 are considered in our study. Based on the
numerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20,
0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising
universality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that
there are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase
transitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is
unlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for
$J_2/|J_1|$ $\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation
times or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature
region. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available
results in the literature is briefly conducted as well.
