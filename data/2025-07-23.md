  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a practical and extensible resource for constructing lattice QCD operators for systems with an arbitrary number of particles, which is essential as lattice calculations progress towards more complex hadronic systems.

Method: The authors have developed a method for constructing lattice QCD operators that can handle any number of particles, with consideration for their momentum, spin, and internal quantum numbers. They also created the OpTion software package to facilitate operator construction.

Result: Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-, three-, and four-hadron operators, including all irreducible representations of relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The OpTion package is made available as an open-source tool for the community.

Conclusion: The paper and the OpTion package serve as a comprehensive guide and toolset for future lattice QCD studies, enabling researchers to tackle increasingly intricate hadronic systems.

Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing lattice QCD operators for
systems of an arbitrary number of particles with arbitrary momentum, spin, and
internal quantum numbers. Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-,
three-, and four-hadron operators, covering all irreducible representations of
the relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The
construction procedure has been implemented in the open-source package
\texttt{OpTion} (Operator construcTion), available at
https://github.com/wittscien/OpTion. The paper and the package are designed to
serve as a practical and extensible dictionary for future lattice QCD studies,
as lattice calculations advance towards increasingly complex hadronic systems.

### [2] [N=1 Supersymmetric QCD on the lattice using overlap fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16651)
*Marios Costa,Eleni Ioannou,Haralambos Panagopoulos*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a lattice formulation for N=1 Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) that incorporates chirally symmetric Yukawa terms, using the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and auxiliary fermionic fields to preserve chiral symmetry and reduce the need for counterterms. The approach sets the stage for future nonperturbative studies of supersymmetric gauge theories and the necessary perturbative fine-tunings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a robust framework for studying supersymmetric gauge theories on the lattice, with an emphasis on maintaining chiral symmetry in the Yukawa interactions and reducing the complexity introduced by additional counterterms, which are typically required in Wilson-type discretizations.

Method: The method involves the use of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, chiral transformations, and the Majorana condition for gluinos to construct a consistent lattice model. Auxiliary fermionic fields are introduced to realize exact chiral symmetry in Yukawa interactions. After integrating out these auxiliary fields, ultralocal interaction terms emerge as new contributions to the lattice action.

Result: A consistent lattice formulation of N=1 SQCD is achieved, preserving a modified chiral symmetry and resulting in fewer required counterterms. The authors also prepare the ground for future work, including the computation of all perturbative fine-tunings needed for continuum matching and numerical simulations of SQCD.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this novel lattice approach provides a solid foundation for nonperturbative studies of supersymmetric gauge theories, with the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of such investigations by incorporating exact chiral symmetry and minimizing the need for counterterms.

Abstract: Using N=1 Supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) as a prototype model, this work presents
a formulation of overlap quarks and gluinos on the lattice, with particular
emphasis on the construction of chirally symmetric Yukawa terms. By
incorporating the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, chiral transformations, and the
Majorana condition for gluinos, we construct a consistent framework that
preserves a lattice-modified chiral symmetry and reduces the number of required
counterterms compared to Wilson-type discretizations. The formulation
introduces auxiliary fermionic fields to realize exact chiral symmetry in
Yukawa interactions and enables a detailed analysis of the resulting matrix
structures. Upon functionally integrating out the auxiliary fields, ultralocal
interaction terms emerge as new contributions to the lattice action. This
approach provides a robust foundation for nonperturbative lattice studies of
supersymmetric gauge theories. Future work will focus on computing all
perturbative fine-tunings required in this formulation to enable continuum
matching and numerical simulations of SQCD.
