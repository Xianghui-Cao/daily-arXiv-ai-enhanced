Using these quantities, the physical point values of the two flow scales, ${t_0^{\\rm Phy}}$ and ${w_0^{\\rm Phy}}$, and the ratio $\\mathop{f_K / f_π}^{\\rm Phy}$ are determined. The masses of the octet and decuplet baryons are analyzed using both the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ansatz from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB$χ$PT). The NNLO fit to the octet baryons, $M_N$, $M_Σ$, $M_Λ$ and $M_Ξ$, is preferred while the corresponding fits to the decuplet Omega mass, $M_Ω$, are not distinguished. We also present a study of the autocorrelations in the data and show that there is no evidence, even at large flow time, of the freezing of the topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator."}

Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM."}
