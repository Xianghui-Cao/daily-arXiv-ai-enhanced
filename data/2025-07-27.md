TL;DR: A new numerical algorithm for the modified Lüscher zeta-function is presented, which is robust against truncation of higher partial waves and allows for natural-sized effective range expansion parameters after renormalization.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon the standard Lüscher approach by providing a more efficient and accurate method for calculating the modified Lüscher zeta-function, especially in the presence of long-range forces, and to address the issues with cutoff regularization.

Method: The paper utilizes a formalism from a previous study on synthetic data of finite-volume energy levels in a toy model to develop a numerical algorithm. The work also includes a detailed discussion on the regularization and renormalization of the modified Lüscher zeta-function, introducing a new renormalization scheme.

Result: The results show that the truncation of higher partial waves has a minimal impact on the final result, and the new renormalization scheme leads to modified effective range expansion parameters of natural size across all partial waves.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and renormalization scheme provide an improved method for handling the modified Lüscher zeta-function, particularly in the context of long-range forces, with better accuracy and without the significant influence of higher partial wave truncations.

Abstract: An efficient numerical algoritm is proposed for the calculation of the
modified L\"uscher zeta-function in the presence of a long-range force. Using
the formalism developed in Ref.~\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of
synthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is
demonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\"uscher approach, the
truncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final
result. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified
L\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising
within the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization
scheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range
expansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.
