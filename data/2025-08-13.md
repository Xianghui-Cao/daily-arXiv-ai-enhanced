*Anthony Francis*

Main category: hep-lat

Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and define the properties of diquarks, which, despite their success in describing low-lying QCD states, have been challenging to pin down definitively.

Method: The method involves studying diquarks in a gauge-invariant setup through embedding them in a parent hadron that contains a heavy spectator quark, utilizing lattice QCD calculations.

Result: The results show progress in understanding diquarks within the described framework, though specific outcomes are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the presentation of progress made in the investigation of diquarks, suggesting advancements in the ability to study and characterize these particles within the context of a parent hadron containing a heavy quark.

Abstract: Diquarks are often invoked as QCD effective degrees of freedom to describe
baryons as well as certain exotic hadrons in phenomenology. However, even
though they are successful in describing many of these low lying QCD states,
they and their properties have been difficult to pin down. Here we present
progress in studying diquarks in a gauge-invariant setup through embedding them
in a parent hadron containing a heavy spectator quark using lattice QCD
calculations.

Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through
the simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice.
We implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons.
Lattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover
fermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice
spacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix
elements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence
associated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix
elements in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual
self-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs
within the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large
separations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results
demonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth,
continuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier
transformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability
of both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs,
providing a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone
distribution amplitudes.

### [3] [Current-Enhanced Excited States in Lattice QCD Three-Point Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09006)
*Lorenzo Barca*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses a general argument for identifying excited states enhanced by the inserted current and kinematics, offering both a conceptual understanding and practical guidance to address excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses, supported by numerical evidence from various hadronic channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to tackle the issue of excited-state contamination, which is a significant source of systematic uncertainty in determining hadron structure observables using lattice QCD. The authors aim to provide a method that helps identify and understand these excited states to improve the accuracy of such determinations.

Method: The authors utilize a theoretical approach based on current-meson dominance, implemented through the variational method, to pinpoint the excited states that are emphasized by the specific choice of the current and the kinematic conditions. This is complemented by numerical simulations across different hadronic channels to support their argument.

Result: The result is the development of an argument that successfully identifies the key excited states that contribute to the contamination, as evidenced by consistent numerical results across multiple hadronic channels. This finding provides a clearer path for researchers to account for these states in their analyses.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that with the presented argument and supporting numerical evidence, there is now a more solid foundation for understanding and mitigating the impact of excited-state contamination in the analysis of hadron structure observables within lattice QCD studies.

Abstract: Excited-state contamination remains one of the leading sources of systematic
uncertainty in the precise determination of hadron structure observables from
lattice QCD. In this letter, we present a general argument, inspired by
current-meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, to
identify which excited states are enhanced by the choice of the inserted
current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence across
multiple hadronic channels and provides both a conceptual understanding and
practical guidance to account for excited-state effects in hadron three-point
function analyses.
