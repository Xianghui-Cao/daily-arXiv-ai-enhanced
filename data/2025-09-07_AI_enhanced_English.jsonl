We use a $24^3\\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an\ninverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\\infty$-based formalism.\nOur implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed\ndiagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision\non the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a\ndestructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the\ndecay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The\nprecision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical\ncontribution of the $\\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are\ntested and compared.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the two-photon-exchange amplitude in the rare $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, revealing a destructive interference between long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand and compute the contribution of the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude to the rare kaon decay $K_{\\rm L}\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$, which requires a detailed analysis of both long- and short-distance effects within the framework of lattice QCD and QED.", "method": "The authors use a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble with a $24^3\\times 64$ lattice and an inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV. They employ a QED${}_\\infty$-based formalism and implement strategies for five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies, achieving 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the amplitude.", "result": "The result shows that there is a destructive interference between the long- and short-distance contributions to the decay amplitude, with the precision being limited by the reconstruction of the $\\eta$ intermediate state's physical contribution, for which different strategies were tested and compared.", "conclusion": "The study provides a significant insight into the rare kaon decay process, offering a first-principles determination of the interference pattern between long- and short-distance amplitudes, although the precision is constrained by the challenge of accurately representing the $\\eta$ meson's role."}}
