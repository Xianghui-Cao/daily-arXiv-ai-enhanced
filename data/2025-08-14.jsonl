We construct Symanzik effective action for KW fermions, which is\nknown to break the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice action. In this work we\nmake the two fermionic modes, called tastes, explicit using the point-splitting\nproposal of Creutz and Misumi and write the KW action in terms of the taste\nfields. We identify the symmetries of the point-split action and write down the\nSymanzik effective action up to dimension-5, including the divergent\ndimension-3, operators for both free and interacting KW fermions."}

We integrate out the gauge and quark\ndegrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of\na tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a\nnumerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order\nin the inverse coupling $\\beta$ and compute analytical results for the\npartition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\\times2$\nlattice up to order $\\beta^4$. In a follow-up paper we will introduce an\nenhanced tensor-network method, order-separated GHOTRG, to explicitly compute\nthe expansion coefficients of the partition function for larger lattices."}

The grand potential is\ncalculated analytically in the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) on the basis\nof the cumulant expansion. Using the grand potential, we compute the quark\nnumber susceptibilities and their ratios up to next-to-leading order in the\nHPE. The ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities is shown to be unity\n(nine) in the deconfined (confined) phase at the leading order. Excitation\nproperties of baryonic and quark modes in each phase are also investigated\nutilizing the Boltzmann statistics. We obtain an analytic formula for the quark\nexcitation energy in the deconfined phase, while that for baryonic excitations\nin the confined phase is decomposed into flavor multiplets."}
