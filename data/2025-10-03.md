Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of understanding the probability distribution effectively sampled by a complex Langevin process in theories with a sign problem, which has been notoriously difficult to comprehend. By leveraging techniques from generative AI, specifically diffusion models, the authors aim to find a new approach to tackle this issue.

Method: The method involves employing and comparing two types of diffusion models - score-based and energy-based - to learn the distributions or their log derivatives that are sampled by the complex Langevin process. This comparison is intended to provide insights into which type of model is more suitable for this particular application.

Result: The results show the potential of diffusion models in learning the distributions generated by a complex Langevin process. The comparison between score-based and energy-based models provides an indication of their relative strengths and weaknesses in this context, though specific outcomes are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The conclusion speculates on the possible applications of using diffusion models to learn distributions from a complex Langevin process, suggesting it as a promising direction for future research to solve the sign problem in certain theories.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can
sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified
configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled
by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to
understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or
their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to
learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing
score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible
applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the effectiveness of automated machine learning algorithms in recognizing different phases of quantum geometries, which could lead to a better understanding and more accurate identification of phase transitions in lattice quantum gravity.

Method: The researchers used numerical data from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations and tested 14 machine learning models (7 supervised and 7 unsupervised) to recognize phase transitions between different quantum geometries.

Result: The study found that most of the machine learning models were highly effective at identifying phase transitions, even surpassing the performance of conventional methods based on order parameters.

Conclusion: Automated machine learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for recognizing phase transitions in the context of lattice quantum gravity, potentially offering a more reliable approach than traditional methods.

Abstract: Using numerical data coming from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional
Causal Dynamical Triangulations, we study how automated machine learning
algorithms can be used to recognize transitions between different phases of
quantum geometries observed in lattice quantum gravity. We tested seven
supervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models and found that most
of them were very successful in that task, even outperforming standard methods
based on order parameters.

### [3] [Flux tubes in QCD at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02177)
*Marshall Baker,Paolo Cea,Volodymyr Chelnokov,Leonardo Cosmai,Alessandro Papa*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the chromo-electric field generated by a static quark-antiquark pair in lattice QCD at various temperatures, finding evidence of a chromo-magnetic current and a nearly uniform longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric field. It also observes that the effective string tension decreases exponentially with temperature, and the flux-tube width follows an inverse-temperature law, suggesting a screened string tension beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the chromo-electric field produced by a quark-antiquark pair at different temperatures, especially around and above the chiral transition, which is crucial for gaining insights into the nature of strong interactions and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered fermions at physical quark masses are employed to study the evolution of the chromo-electric field as a function of temperature. The researchers analyze the chromo-magnetic current, the longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric field, and the characteristics of the flux tube, including its effective string tension and width.

Result: Evidence of a chromo-magnetic current and a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric field along the flux tube is found. The effective string tension of the flux tube decreases exponentially with increasing temperature, while the width of the flux tube decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. These results indicate that the quark-antiquark system can be described by a screened string tension above the chiral pseudocritical temperature.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the behavior of the quark-antiquark system at high temperatures, revealing the presence of a screened string tension. This has implications for our understanding of the deconfinement phase transition and the properties of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in heavy-ion collisions.

Abstract: We present results for the chromo-electric field generated by a static
quark-antiquark pair at finite temperature, in lattice QCD with 2+1 dynamical
staggered fermions at physical quark masses. We investigate the evolution of
the field as the temperature increases through and beyond the chiral
transition. For all the temperatures considered we find clear evidence of a
chromo-magnetic current and of a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric
field that stays almost uniform along the flux tube. In the high-temperature
region the magnitude of the flux-tube field is determined by an effective
string tension that decreases exponentially as the temperature increases, while
the flux-tube width decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. Our
results suggest that beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature the
quark-antiquark system can be characterized by a screened string tension.
