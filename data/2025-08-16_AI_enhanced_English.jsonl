The charm quark is implemented with a\nrelativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the\ntime-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in\nthe spin-1 ($^3\\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are\nextracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering\nparameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\\right)$ fm and\n$r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\\right)$ fm for the\n$^3\\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and\n  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\\right)$ fm and $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} =\n2.04(0.10)\\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\\right)$ fm for the $^5\\mathrm{S}_2$ channel,\nindicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are\nfurther decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The\nspin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range\nattractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent\npotential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2)\nchannel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\\psi$ and\n$N$-$\\Omega_{\\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\\pi \\simeq 146$ MeV are provided,\nemphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from\nsoft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm\nquark mass dependence of the $N$-$\\Omega_{\\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated\nas well.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon using lattice QCD, revealing overall attraction in both spin-1 and spin-2 channels but no dibaryon bound state. The potentials are decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components, with the former showing a short-range attractive core and long-range tail, and the latter indicating short-range attraction or repulsion depending on the spin channel. Comparisons to other systems highlight the importance of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability.", "motivation": "To understand the S-wave interactions between a nucleon and a triply charmed Omega baryon, which could provide insights into the nature of strong force at work between these particles and the possible formation of exotic states such as dibaryons.", "method": "The researchers used (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations with a physical pion mass on a defined lattice volume. They employed a relativistic heavy-quark action for the charm quark and utilized the time-dependent HAL QCD method to extract the N-$\\Omega_{\\\\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 and spin-2 channels. The extracted potentials were further analyzed by decomposing them into spin-independent and spin-dependent parts.", "result": "The analysis found overall attraction in both the spin-1 and spin-2 channels, with scattering parameters suggesting the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The spin-independent potential was characterized by a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential showed short-range attraction in the spin-1 channel and short-range repulsion in the spin-2 channel. Additional comparisons with other hadronic systems emphasized the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability.", "conclusion": "The study provides evidence for an attractive interaction between the nucleon and the triply charmed Omega baryon, but does not support the existence of a bound dibaryon state. The decomposition of the potential into spin-independent and -dependent parts reveals the structure of the interaction, with the spin-independent part being dominant. The results also suggest that heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability plays a significant role in these interactions."}}
