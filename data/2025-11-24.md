### [1] [Euclidean coordinate-space perturbation theory with a single mass scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17349)
*Christoph L. Schröder,Harvey B. Meyer*

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a theoretical framework and analytical tools for the study of massive quantum field theories, particularly useful for complex perturbative calculations, finite temperature/volume effects, and lattice QCD treatments.

Method: The method involves using Gegenbauer polynomial expansion and systematically studying antiderivatives of products of Bessel functions. The authors apply these methods to calculate one-loop propagators in both vacuum and at finite temperature.

Result: The results include analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with mixed mass particles, as well as specific computations of one-loop propagators under different conditions.

Conclusion: The developed framework and obtained results are expected to contribute to more accurate and efficient perturbative calculations in quantum field theories, especially in scenarios involving high-degree vertices and hadronic effects.

Abstract: We develop elements of coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in general $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature.

### [2] [Primitive Quantum Gates for an $SU(3)$ Discrete Subgroup: $Σ(72\times3)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17437)
*Sebastian Osorio Perez,Edison M. Murairi,Erik J. Gustafson,Henry Lamm*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a set of basic quantum gates for simulating a discrete subgroup of SU(3) and provides qubit decompositions for these gates, with an estimate of the T gate costs for a shear viscosity calculation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a primitive gate set that can be used for digital quantum simulation of a specific discrete subgroup of SU(3), which is relevant for certain physical calculations such as shear viscosity, while aiming for fault-tolerant and efficient computation in terms of T gate count.

Method: The method involves constructing a set of essential quantum gates, including the inversion gate, group multiplication gate, trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, and providing their respective qubit decompositions suitable for digital quantum simulation.

Result: The result is a complete set of quantum gates necessary for simulating the 216-element Σ(72×3) subgroup of SU(3), with an estimated requirement of about 10^12 T gates for a fiducial shear viscosity calculation, which is considered favorable compared to other estimates.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the proposed primitive gate set, along with the provided qubit decompositions, offers a promising approach for the digital quantum simulation of the specified SU(3) subgroup, with potential applications in calculating physical properties like shear viscosity, and the cost of T gates is within an acceptable range for practical quantum computing.

Abstract: We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of a discrete subgroup of $SU(3)$: the 216-element $Σ(72\times3)$. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions. The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity would require about $10^{12}$ T gates which compares favorably to other modern estimates.
