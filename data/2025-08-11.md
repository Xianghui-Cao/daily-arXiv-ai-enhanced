Motivation: To better understand the behavior of the pion under different kinematic conditions and to assess the accuracy and validity of lattice QCD simulations against theoretical expectations.

Method: Computational techniques are used to extract energy eigenvalues from two-point correlation function data simulated using lattice QCD. The extracted values are obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph and used to plot the pion's dispersion relation.

Result: The dispersion relation derived from the energy eigenvalues is compared with theoretical predictions, providing insights into the reliability of the range of kinematic variables in the lattice QCD simulations.

Conclusion: The comparison between the computed dispersion relation and theoretical predictions validates the use of lattice QCD for simulating pion behavior, and identifies the reliable range of kinematic variables within the simulations.

Abstract: In this report, computational techniques are employed to extract the energy
eigenvalues of the pion from two-point correlation function data that has been
simulated using the lattice formulation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) across
various momentum values for the particle. The analysis focuses on
systematically obtaining these eigenvalues to understand better the behavior of
the pion under different kinematic conditions. Once extracted, these energy
eigenvalues obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph, are
utilized to plot the dispersion relation of the pion. This resulting dispersion
relation is then compared with theoretical predictions to assess the accuracy
and validity of the computational approach. The comparison provides insights
into how well the lattice QCD simulations align with established theoretical
expectations, and what range of kinematic variables are reliable.

### [2] [A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05967)
*Rajamani Narayanan,Ray Romero*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of massless overlap fermions in 2D $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories, focusing on their mod(2) index and the impact of boundary conditions on their continuum limit. It provides numerical evidence that only one class of lattice gauge fields survives in the continuum limit, leading to two out of four possible partition functions being zero. The authors define a topological condensate as an observable, which remains non-zero even as the torus size approaches infinity, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. A plaquette model is proposed to replicate the infinite volume physics using a single partition function.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the rigidity of the spectrum of massless overlap fermions in 2D $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories and its implications for the mod(2) index. The study aims to investigate how the boundary conditions of the fermion and gauge field affect the survival of certain classes of lattice gauge fields in the continuum limit, and to explore the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit, which are absent in finite volumes.

Method: The method involves numerical simulations of $SU(2)$ gauge theory with a single Majorana fermion in integer representations, examining the partition functions and the topological condensate. The authors also study the spectral density of the fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to demonstrate the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the presence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit. A modified plaquette model is introduced to reproduce the correct physics in the infinite volume limit.

Result: The results show that only one class of lattice gauge fields survives in the continuum limit, depending on the boundary conditions, resulting in two of the four possible partition functions being zero. The topological condensate, defined as the ratio of mixed partition functions, has a non-zero value in both finite and infinite volume limits. There is no spontaneous symmetry breaking, but zero modes emerge in the infinite volume limit, which is not observed in finite volumes. The findings are consistent for different integer representations (J = 1, 2, 3, 4).

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the mod(2) index of massless overlap fermions in 2D $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories is determined by the survival of a specific class of lattice gauge fields in the continuum limit. The topological condensate, as an observable, remains non-zero in all physical scenarios, indicating the presence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit. The proposed plaquette model accurately captures the infinite volume physics using a single partition function, providing a simplified approach to understanding the system.

Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional
$SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its
spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice
gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set
of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a
single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical
evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and
this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As
such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum
limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero
modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define
an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition
functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has
a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a
non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the
spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the
size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but
the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited
in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These
results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces
the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition
function.
