Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(φ)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $μ=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(φ)$ and coupling $f(φ)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models."}

The lattice data rely on matrix elements calculated for boosted mesons coupled to non-local operators containing a Wilson line. The calculations on this lattice ensemble correspond to two degenerate light, a strange, and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$), using maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover term. The lattice volume is $32^3\\times 64$, with a lattice spacing of 0.0934 fm, and a pion mass of 260 MeV. Matrix elements are calculated for hadron boosts of $|P_3| = 0,~0.41,~0.83,~1.25,~1.66,$ and 2.07 GeV. To match lattice QCD results to their light-cone counterparts, we employ two complementary frameworks: the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and the short-distance factorization (SDF). Using these approaches in parallel, we also test the lattice data to identify methodology-driven systematics. Results are presented for the standard quark PDFs, as well as the valence sector. Beyond obtaining the PDFs, we also explore the possibility of extracting information on SU(3) flavor-symmetry-breaking effects. For LaMET, we also parametrize the momentum dependence to obtain the infinite-momentum PDFs."}

Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena."}

In the joint large-$N$, large-$N_f$ limit with fixed ratio $κ= N_f/N$, the mean-field approximation becomes exact, and the core of the Polyakov loop model reduces to a deformed unitary matrix model, which we solve analytically. In particular, we compute the free energy and its derivatives, the expectation values of the Polyakov loop, and the baryon density, and we describe the phase diagram of the model in detail. We show how the $SU(N)$ case differs from the corresponding $U(N)$ model and how the three-phase structure known from one-dimensional QCD at finite density extends to non-zero coupling."}
