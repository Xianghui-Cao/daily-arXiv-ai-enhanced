This quantity is directly related to the confining mechanism which generates the flux tube and can be used to test its properties. We study a wide range of different values of lattice spacing, temperature and flux tube lengths and show that our data are precise enough to distinguish between different confining models. In particular we show that at high temperatures (just below the deconfinement transition) the data are perfectly described by an Ising-like effective model based on the Svetitsky-Yaffe mapping. At lower temperatures this approximation does not hold anymore. In this regime (which is the most interesting one from a physical point of view) we test several alternative proposals and show that the dual superconductor model is the one which better fits the data. However, this proposal is not fully satisfactory, because the values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter extracted from the fits increase with the length of the flux tube, which is not a feature predicted by the model. This suggests that a more sophisticated model is needed to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories and, at the same time, that our data on the intrinsic width may be a powerful tool to benchmark these candidates.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the 'intrinsic width' of the flux tube in the SU(2) gauge model, which is related to the confining mechanism. The study covers a range of lattice spacing, temperature, and flux tube lengths, finding that at high temperatures an Ising-like effective model fits the data, while at lower temperatures, the dual superconductor model is a better fit, though not fully satisfactory, suggesting the need for a more advanced model to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the confining mechanism in the SU(2) gauge model by studying the intrinsic width of the flux tube, which is a new physical scale. This research aims to test the properties of the confining mechanism and to determine which theoretical models best describe the behavior of the flux tube under different conditions.", "method": "The method involves computational simulations across a wide range of parameters including lattice spacing, temperature, and flux tube lengths. The researchers compare their precise data with predictions from various confining models, such as the Ising-like effective model and the dual superconductor model, to assess which one provides the best description of the observed behavior.", "result": "At high temperatures, the data are well described by an Ising-like effective model, while at lower temperatures, the dual superconductor model offers a better fit. However, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter values increase with the flux tube length, which is not consistent with the dual superconductor model's predictions, indicating the need for a more sophisticated model.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the intrinsic width of the flux tube can be used as a tool to benchmark confining models in non-abelian gauge theories. The dual superconductor model is the most fitting at lower temperatures, but its inadequacies suggest that a more refined model is required to fully explain the phenomenon of confinement."}}

Our network architecture is based on lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs), which respect local and global symmetries on the lattice. Models are trained on a single ensemble generated using a traditional Monte Carlo method. By studying Wilson loops of various size as well as the topological susceptibility, we find that the diffusion approach generalizes remarkably well to larger inverse couplings and lattice sizes with negligible loss of accuracy while retaining moderately high acceptance rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents the use of gauge equivariant diffusion models, specifically L-CNNs, to effectively model non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. It demonstrates that this method generalizes well to larger scales and maintains accuracy across different physical observables.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore a new computational approach for simulating non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, which are fundamental in understanding strong interactions in particle physics. The goal is to develop a method that can handle the complexity of these theories while being computationally efficient and accurate over a range of parameters.", "method": "The authors employ a Metropolis-adjusted annealed Langevin algorithm (MAALA) with lattice gauge equivariant convolutional neural networks (L-CNNs) to simulate two-dimensional U(2) and SU(2) gauge theories. The L-CNN architecture ensures that the symmetries of the lattice gauge theory are respected.

The ability to generalize well to varying conditions and maintain high acceptance rates makes this method particularly valuable for further research in theoretical physics."}}
