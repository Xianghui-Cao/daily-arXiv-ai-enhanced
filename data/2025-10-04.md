  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding the probability distribution effectively sampled by the complex Langevin process in theories with a sign problem, which is notoriously difficult to comprehend. The authors are driven by the potential of generative AI, particularly diffusion models, to offer a solution for learning such distributions or their log derivatives from data, thus providing a new approach to tackle this longstanding issue.

Method: The method involves the application of diffusion models, including both score-based and energy-based types, to learn the distributions that are generated through a complex Langevin process. This computational technique allows for the comparison of these two types of diffusion models in the context of sampling from complexified configuration spaces.

Result: The results of the study would include the comparative performance of score-based versus energy-based diffusion models in learning the targeted distributions, as well as insights into the characteristics of the learned distributions. The research also provides speculative discussions on how these findings could be applied to further problems within the field.

Conclusion: The conclusion speculates about the potential applications of using diffusion models to understand the complex Langevin process, suggesting that these models might provide a new avenue for tackling the sign problem in theories with a complex action or Boltzmann weight.

Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can
sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified
configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled
by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to
understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or
their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to
learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing
score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible
applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the effectiveness of automated machine learning algorithms in recognizing phase transitions within the context of lattice quantum gravity, specifically using data from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations. The goal is to potentially improve upon or offer alternatives to conventional methods that use order parameters for identifying such transitions.

Method: The researchers utilized a combination of seven supervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models. These models were applied to numerical data generated by Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations to classify and recognize different phases of quantum geometries.

Result: Most of the tested machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised, demonstrated high success rates in identifying phase transitions between different states of quantum geometries. The performance of these models was found to be superior to that of standard techniques based on order parameters.

Conclusion: The research concludes that automated machine learning algorithms can be highly effective in detecting phase transitions in lattice quantum gravity, with many models outperforming traditional methods. This suggests a promising approach for future studies in this field.

Abstract: Using numerical data coming from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional
Causal Dynamical Triangulations, we study how automated machine learning
algorithms can be used to recognize transitions between different phases of
quantum geometries observed in lattice quantum gravity. We tested seven
supervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models and found that most
of them were very successful in that task, even outperforming standard methods
based on order parameters.

### [3] [Flux tubes in QCD at finite temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02177)
*Marshall Baker,Paolo Cea,Volodymyr Chelnokov,Leonardo Cosmai,Alessandro Papa*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study investigates the chromo-electric field between a quark-antiquark pair at different temperatures in lattice QCD, finding evidence of a chromo-magnetic current and a nearly uniform longitudinal chromo-electric field. The string tension of the flux tube decreases exponentially with temperature, and the width narrows as temperature increases, suggesting a screened string tension above the chiral transition temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the chromo-electric field generated by a static quark-antiquark pair across the chiral phase transition in the context of finite-temperature lattice QCD, which is crucial for insights into the properties of QCD matter at high temperatures.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 dynamical staggered fermions at physical quark masses are used to examine the chromo-electric field's evolution with increasing temperature, including the analysis of the effective string tension and the flux-tube characteristics.

Result: There is a clear presence of a chromo-magnetic current and a nonperturbative, almost uniform, longitudinal chromo-electric field along the flux tube. The string tension associated with the flux tube decreases exponentially with temperature, while the width of the flux tube follows an inverse-temperature law, indicating screening effects above the chiral pseudocritical temperature.

Conclusion: The research concludes that the quark-antiquark system at high temperatures can be characterized by a screened string tension, providing a deeper understanding of the QCD dynamics in the high-temperature regime.

Abstract: We present results for the chromo-electric field generated by a static
quark-antiquark pair at finite temperature, in lattice QCD with 2+1 dynamical
staggered fermions at physical quark masses. We investigate the evolution of
the field as the temperature increases through and beyond the chiral
transition. For all the temperatures considered we find clear evidence of a
chromo-magnetic current and of a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric
field that stays almost uniform along the flux tube. In the high-temperature
region the magnitude of the flux-tube field is determined by an effective
string tension that decreases exponentially as the temperature increases, while
the flux-tube width decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. Our
results suggest that beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature the
quark-antiquark system can be characterized by a screened string tension.
