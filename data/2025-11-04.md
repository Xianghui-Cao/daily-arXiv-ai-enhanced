*João Barata,Juan Hormaza,Zhong-Bo Kang,Wenyang Qian*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques, focusing on the dynamics across sectors of fixed global baryon number B = 0, 1, 2. It characterizes the scattering processes and provides a benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering, paving the way for quantum-simulation studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the dynamics of hadronic scattering in a simplified model of a non-Abelian gauge theory, specifically in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions, without truncating the electric flux and by integrating out the gauge field exactly. The aim is to provide insights into baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes that could be extended to more complex theories.

Method: The method involves using tensor-network techniques within the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation to simulate and analyze scattering processes in different baryon number sectors (B = 0, 1, 2). The authors examine local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice to understand the correlation buildup and relaxation during interactions.

Result: At strong coupling, the B = 0 and B = 2 channels show predominantly elastic dynamics similar to those found in the U(1) Schwinger model, while the B = 1 sector displays new behavior where meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during collision, leading to spatial delocalization of the slower state and ballistic propagation of the faster one, depending on initial kinematics.

Conclusion: The results establish a benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and demonstrate the potential for future quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.

Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a
(1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using
tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation --
where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the
electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors
of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to
meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling,
the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely
resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$
sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become
entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the
slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates
ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables,
entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how
correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a
first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and
open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and
inelastic processes in gauge theories.

### [2] [opbasis - a Python package to derive minimal operator bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00165)
*Nikolai Husung*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new Python package is introduced for lattice field theorists, designed to find a complete and minimal on-shell basis of operators for Effective Field Theories (EFTs), with a focus on 4D non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. It's flexible enough to be extended to other discrete symmetries and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bottleneck in systematic studies of leading logarithmic corrections to integer-power lattice artifacts in Symanzik EFT, which is finding a suitable operator basis, especially when dealing with discrete symmetry transformations that are common in lattice field theory but complicate the use of standard continuum field theory tools.

Method: The method involves the development and presentation of a Python package that can be used to derive operator bases for EFTs. The package is demonstrated through three examples, each showcasing different features and the ability to extend its functionality by the user.

Result: The result is a versatile Python package capable of handling the derivation of operator bases for EFTs, including the O(a) operator basis of the axial-vector in Wilson QCD, operator bases for unrooted Staggered quarks, and a B*(p)π(-p) operator with pseudo-scalar quantum numbers. The package allows for easy extension to new discrete symmetries and additional functionalities.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this Python package provides a valuable tool for lattice field theorists, offering a means to efficiently derive operator bases for EFTs and extending its applicability to a wider range of theories and applications beyond the initial scope.

Abstract: Finding a complete and yet minimal on-shell basis of operators of a given
mass-dimension that are compatible with a specific set of transformation
properties is the first step in any Effective Field Theory description. This
step is the main bottleneck for systematic studies of leading logarithmic
corrections to integer-power lattice artifacts in Symanzik Effective Field
Theory targeting various local fields and lattice actions. The focus on
discrete symmetry transformations in lattice field theory, especially reduced
hypercubic spacetime symmetry with Euclidean signature, complicates the use of
standard continuum field theory tools.
  Here, a new Python package is being presented that targets the typical
lattice field-theorist's use cases. While the main target lies on continuum
EFTs describing 4D non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, the applicability can be
extended beyond Effective Field Theories. New discrete symmetries, twisted
masses, or the introduction of boosts are just a few examples of possible
extensions that can be easily implemented by the user. This should allow for a
wider range of theories and applications beyond the initial focus of this
package.
  The general functionality of the package is explained along the lines of
three examples: The $\mathrm{O}(a)$ operator basis of the axial-vector in
Wilson QCD, operator bases compatible with the symmetries of unrooted Staggered
quarks as well as a pedestrian derivation of a
$B^*(\mathbf{p})\pi(-\mathbf{p})$ operator with pseudo-scalar quantum numbers.
Each example makes use of an increasing range of features and requires
user-defined extensions show-casing the versatility of the package.

### [3] [An effective field theory for thermal QCD with 2+1 flavours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00409)
*Sourendu Gupta,Pritam Sen,Rishi Sharma*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: An effective field theory (EFT) for QCD at finite temperature just below the crossover temperature $T_c$ is developed, with its low energy constants (LECs) derived from lattice measurements of pion screening masses. The EFT provides accurate predictions for static pion properties and the phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$ and gives good predictions for pressure and a real-time quantity known as the kinetic mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an effective field theory (EFT) that can accurately describe QCD behavior at finite temperatures near the crossover temperature, which is important for understanding the quark-gluon plasma and other phenomena in high-energy physics. By using lattice QCD results, the researchers aim to obtain a reliable EFT that can make predictions for different numbers of flavors ($N_f$) where direct lattice simulations are not available or are computationally expensive.

Method: The method involves constructing a long-distance EFT for QCD and determining its low energy constants (LECs) by fitting to lattice QCD data on pion screening masses at two temperatures. The EFT is then used to predict other static pion properties, the phase diagram, and the pressure for $N_f = 2+1$. Additionally, the EFT is employed to predict a real-time quantity, the kinetic mass, after Wick rotation.

Result: The EFT provides good predictions for static pion properties for $N_f = 2$, where lattice results are available for comparison. It also gives excellent predictions for the phase diagram in the $N_f = 2+1$ case. Furthermore, the EFT predicts the pressure and the kinetic mass, which have not yet been measured directly via lattice simulations for $N_f = 2+1$.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the constructed EFT successfully describes the QCD system at finite temperatures close to the crossover temperature, providing a valuable tool for making predictions in regimes where direct lattice calculations are not feasible. The EFT's ability to predict the phase diagram, pressure, and kinetic mass for $N_f = 2+1$ suggests its potential utility in further studies of QCD thermodynamics and phase transitions.

Abstract: We write a long-distance effective field theory (EFT) for QCD at finite
temperature just below the crossover temperature $T_c$. The low energy
constants (LECs) of this EFT are obtained from lattice measurements of the
screening mass of pions at two temperatures for $N_f=2+1$ using lattice results
obtained at physical values of pion and Kaon masses, and $N_f=2$ where the
lattice simulations were performed with a heavier pion mass. The EFT gives good
predictions for other static pion properties for $N_f=2$, where lattice results
are available. We show the corresponding predictions for $N_f=2+1$, where they
are not yet measured. We demonstrate that EFT gives excellent predictions for
the phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$. The predictions for the pressure are
investigated, and predictions are also given for a Wick-rotated real-time
quantity called the kinetic mass.

### [4] [Precision lattice calculation of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electroweak gauge couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01623)
*Alessandro Conigli,Dalibor Djukanovic,Georg von Hippel,Simon Kuberski,Harvey B. Meyer,Kohtaroh Miura,Konstantin Ottnad,Andreas Risch,Hartmut Wittig*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper updates the lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling and the electroweak mixing angle, revealing tensions with data-driven estimates and providing a more precise value for Δα^(5)_had(M_Z^2) at the Z-pole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the precision of the lattice QCD determination of Δα^(5)_had(-Q^2) and the electroweak mixing angle, and to resolve discrepancies between lattice results and data-driven estimates based on e+e- cross section data.

Method: The authors use CLS ensembles with 2+1 flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions, covering five lattice spacings and various pion masses, including the physical point. They employ a refined analysis with a telescopic window strategy and low-mode averaging, along with spectral reconstruction of the vector-vector correlator.

Result: The study confirms significant tensions (up to 7σ) between lattice results and data-driven estimates for Δα^(5)_had(-Q^2) at space-like virtualities around 1 GeV^2. The new lattice data combined with perturbative QCD yields a highly precise value of Δα^(5)_had(M_Z^2) at the Z-pole, which slightly deviates from global electroweak fits. Additionally, a precise determination of the octet-singlet mixing component is provided, in agreement with phenomenological models.

Conclusion: The updated lattice QCD results provide a more accurate and precise determination of the hadronic contributions to the electromagnetic coupling and electroweak mixing angle, highlighting the need for further investigation into the observed tensions with data-driven methods.

Abstract: We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the hadronic
contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling,
$\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$, and of the electroweak mixing angle
in the space-like momentum region up to $Q^2=12\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$. The
calculation is based on CLS ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of
$O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, covering five lattice spacings between $0.039$
and $0.085$ fm and a range of pion masses, including the physical point. A
refined analysis employing a telescopic window strategy allows for a clean
separation of systematic effects across Euclidean distance scales. Statistical
precision is further enhanced through low-mode averaging, combined with a
spectral reconstruction of the vector-vector correlator at long distances on
the most chiral ensembles. We confirm significant tensions of up to $7\sigma$
at space-like virtualities around $Q^2= 1\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$ between our lattice
results for $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$ and the corresponding
data-driven estimates based on $e^+e^-$ cross section data. Combining our
lattice data with perturbative QCD via the Euclidean split technique, we obtain
at the $Z$-pole $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(M_Z^2) =
0.027813(33)_{\mathrm{lat}}(35)_{\mathrm{pQCD}}$, which is more than two times
more precise than recent data-driven estimates. Our result deviates slightly,
by $1-2\sigma$, from the value produced by global electroweak fits. For the
electroweak mixing angle, we present the hadronic contribution to its running
and provide a precise determination of the octet-singlet mixing component
$\bar\Pi^{(0,8)}$, in good agreement with phenomenological models but with
significantly higher precision.

### [5] [Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818)
*Xiang Gao,Swagato Mukherjee,Qi Shi,Fei Yao,Yong Zhao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark GPD up to fifth order, using an operator product expansion. The study uses a lattice spacing of 0.04 fm and a pion mass of 300 MeV, with boosted pion states and momentum transfers up to 2.748 GeV^2. It employs ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching, and the results at zero skewness are consistent with previous studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to provide detailed lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of the pion's valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) to better understand the internal structure of the pion and its quark-gluon dynamics. The authors aim to extend the existing knowledge by calculating higher-order moments and exploring the dependence on the skewness parameter, which is important for understanding the spatial distribution of quarks within the pion.

Method: The method involves lattice QCD simulations with a specific ensemble characterized by a lattice spacing of 0.04 fm and a valence pion mass of 300 MeV. They use boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers up to 2.748 GeV^2. The calculations are based on the operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators, and they apply ratio-scheme renormalization as well as next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching to obtain the results.

Result: The results include the calculation of odd Mellin moments of the pion's valence-quark GPD up to the fifth order, with a skewness range from -0.33 to 0. The findings are consistent with previous lattice studies at zero skewness. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, the researchers were able to extract skewness-dependent moments through polynomiality-constrained fits.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of the pion valence-quark GPD are successfully performed, extending the available data to higher orders and non-zero skewness. The consistency with previous results at zero skewness and the new insights into the skewness dependence of the moments contribute to a deeper understanding of the pion's partonic structure.

Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion
valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle
x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product
expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed
on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass
$300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428
GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme
renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching.
At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By
combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer,
skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous
polynomiality-constrained fits.
