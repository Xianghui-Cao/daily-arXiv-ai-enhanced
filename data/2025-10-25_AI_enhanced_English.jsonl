The sea sector is based on gauge\nensembles with $N_{\\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved\nWilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)\ninitiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five\nvalues of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the\nphysical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ\nWilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless\nWilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the\nstrategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses\nalong the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is\nthen conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action\napproach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion\nregularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,\nwe conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the\nmasses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow\nscale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct\nways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their\ncombination. We observe that the latter combination results in enhanced control\nof the systematic uncertainties, thereby yielding a precise determination of\nthe physical value of $t_0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "A mixed action approach in lattice QCD is introduced, using Wilson-type quarks in both sea and valence sectors. The method involves gauge ensembles with 2+1 flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions, and the valence sector uses Wilson twisted-mass fermions. A mass matching strategy is described, and a universality test compares results from mixed-action and unitary setups. Scale setting is performed using pion and kaon masses and decay constants, as well as the gradient flow scale $t_0$, with the combination of both approaches providing a more precise determination of $t_0$.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a mixed action approach that can be used for simulations in lattice QCD, which allows for a comparison between different regularizations (mixed-action and unitary) and provides a means to set the scale with high precision by combining the advantages of both methods.", "method": "The method employs a mixed action setup with non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson fermions in the sea sector and Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist in the valence sector. It includes a mass matching procedure and a universality test through the comparison of continuum-limit results from the mixed-action and unitary setups. Scale setting is achieved using the masses and decay constants of pions and kaons, along with the gradient flow scale $t_0$.", "result": "The result is a successful implementation of a mixed-action approach in lattice QCD, with a demonstration of its consistency with the unitary setup. The combination of both approaches leads to an enhanced control over systematic uncertainties, resulting in a more precise determination of the physical value of the gradient flow scale $t_0$.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the mixed-action approach is consistent with the unitary setup, and when combined, they provide a powerful tool for scale setting in lattice QCD, offering a significant reduction in systematic uncertainties and a more accurate determination of the physical value of $t_0$."}}
