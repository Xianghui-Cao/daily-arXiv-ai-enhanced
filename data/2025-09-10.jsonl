Integration contours with numerically optimal signal-to-noise ratios in simple fermionic toy models", "comment": "10 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We perform a detailed analysis of the fermionic sign problem in a series of\none dimensional integrals, that are achieved as extreme (one-site) limits of\ngenuine physics models. Altogether we studied a Hubbard-like, a\nGross-Neveu-like, a Thirring-like and a Chern-Simons-like integral. We compare\nthe Lefschetz-thimble structure for these integrals with contours obtained with\nthe holomorphic flow equations at different flow-times and with numerically\noptimized continuous integration contours, defined by a maximal value of the\nexpectation values of the phases. With the holomorphic flow equation, we\nperform the large flow-time limit, so that the average phase corresponds to its\nvalue on the thimbles. In some of these integrals (the Hubbard-, Gross-Neveu-,\nand Chern-Simons-like integrals), we observe that the convergence to this value\nis not monotonic, meaning that there is an optimal flow-time where the sign\nproblem is weaker than it is on the thimbles. Furthermore, we find that for all\nof these toy models, numerical optimization can find continuous contours on\nwhich the sign problem is considerably weaker than it is both on the thimbles\nand at flowed integration contours at the optimal flow-time."}
