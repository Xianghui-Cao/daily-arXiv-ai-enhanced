Motivation: The motivation is to determine the gluon momentum fraction within the nucleon accurately by employing advanced techniques in lattice QCD and reducing systematic uncertainties through rigorous methodologies.

Method: The method involves using lattice QCD with Nf = 2+1 flavors at a specific pion mass and lattice spacing, applying the variational method and distillation framework to minimize excited-state contamination, and utilizing Bayesian model averaging for fit procedures. The results are matched to the MS-scheme at 2 GeV using flow-time dependent matching coefficients.

Result: The final result for the gluon momentum fraction is <x>_g(μ= 2 GeV) = 0.482(35), which includes only the statistical uncertainties from the analysis.

Conclusion: The study concludes with a precise determination of the gluon momentum fraction, contributing to the understanding of the nucleon's structure and the role of gluons within it, while highlighting the importance of controlling systematic errors in such calculations.

Abstract: We calculate the gluon momentum fraction of the nucleon using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with a nonperturbative renormalization technique based on the gradient flow. The gluon momentum fraction is determined on a single Wilson-clover ensemble using Nf = 2+1 flavors with pion mass 358 MeV and lattice spacing 0.094 fm. We employ the variational method to reduce excited-state contamination and apply the distillation framework to ensure a large operator basis. To reduce systematic uncertainties, we apply Bayesian model averaging to all fit procedures. We apply matching coefficients to the flow-time dependent lattice results to recover the gluon momentum fraction in the MS-scheme at 2 GeV. Our final result is <x>_g(μ= 2 GeV) = 0.482(35), where we quote only statistical uncertainties.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of using half-precision (FP16) in mixed-precision linear solvers for lattice QCD simulations, introducing rescaling to improve numerical stability. The FP16 version of the solver is found to be practical, with a manageable increase in iteration count compared to double-precision (FP64).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the use of half-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) in mixed-precision linear solvers for lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) simulations, as a means to potentially reduce computational costs and resource usage.

Method: The method involves incorporating rescaling steps into both the outer iterative refinement and the inner BiCGStab solver to mitigate numerical instability associated with lower-precision arithmetic. The study uses a simple Wilson kernel to test the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: The results show that the FP16-based solver, with rescaling, has improved stability, and the number of additional iterations required compared to an FP64 version does not exceed 20%, suggesting that the FP16 version is practical for lattice QCD simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using half-precision (FP16) in mixed-precision linear solvers, with the addition of rescaling, can be a practical choice for lattice QCD simulations, and the rescaling methods may also be beneficial for other mixed-precision preconditioners to prevent underflows.

Abstract: We investigate the use of half-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) in mixed-precision linear solvers for lattice QCD simulations. Since the emergence of GPUs for general-purpose, mixed-precision algorithms that combine single-precision (FP32) with double-precision (FP64) arithmetics have become widely used in this field and others. While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use. We believe that the proposed rescaling methods can also benefit other mixed precision preconditioners in avoiding underflows.

### [3] [Accelerating iterative linear equation solver using modified domain-wall fermion matrix in lattice QCD simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14454)
*Wei-Lun Chen,Issaku Kanamori,Hideo Matsufuru,Hartmut Neff*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper examines an improved variant of the domain-wall fermion operator in lattice QCD simulations, focusing on its ability to accelerate the solving of a 5D linear equation and its impact on the convergence. The study uses the Bridge++ code set, which is planned for release with GPU support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational cost associated with the domain-wall fermion operator in lattice QCD, which is high due to the need to solve a linear equation in 5D space while preserving chiral symmetry. An improved variant of the operator is proposed to enhance the convergence of the 5D linear equation without altering the 4D solution vector.

Method: The researchers use the Bridge++ code set to measure the eigenvalues of the improved domain-wall operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the iterative solver. The method involves practical setups that are relevant for lattice QCD simulations, and the code set will be released with the improved form of the operator and GPU compatibility.

Result: The results show how the improved variant of the domain-wall operator affects the acceleration of the iterative linear equation solver. Additionally, the comparison between the condition number and the convergence of the solver provides insights into the performance of the new operator.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely summarize the findings regarding the effectiveness of the improved domain-wall operator in accelerating the iterative solver and maintaining the accuracy of the 4D solution. It may also discuss the implications for future lattice QCD simulations and the benefits of the forthcoming release of the enhanced Bridge++ code set.

Abstract: Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU.

### [4] [RG-Invariant Symmetry Ratio for QCD: A Study of $U(1)_A$ and Chiral Symmetry Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14811)
*Ting-Wai Chiu,Tung-Han Hsieh*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new observable, the symmetry strength parameter $\kappa_{AB}$, is introduced to quantify symmetry breaking in QCD. Using this, the study finds that at finite lattice spacing, there's a clear hierarchy of symmetry-breaking strengths, which collapses upon continuum extrapolation. The findings suggest a two-stage restoration scenario for chiral and axial symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to quantitatively characterize symmetry breaking in QCD by introducing a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $\kappa_{AB}$. This provides a means to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking, aiming to understand the effective restoration scales and the conditions under which full symmetry restoration occurs.

Method: The method involves employing the symmetry strength parameter $\kappa_{AB}$ in a simulation with $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. The investigation covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures ranging from 164-385 MeV. Three independent symmetry-breaking channels are examined: the scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($\kappa_{PS}$), the vector-axial-vector channel ($\kappa_{VA}$), and the tensor-axial-tensor channel ($\kappa_{TX}$).

Result: At finite lattice spacing, a clear hierarchy of symmetry-breaking strengths is observed: $\kappa_{PS} > \kappa_{TX} \sim \kappa_{VA}$. After a controlled continuum extrapolation, this hierarchy collapses, and all three symmetry-breaking strengths become statistically indistinguishable within the precision of the study. The results indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ converge near the chiral crossover, suggesting a two-stage restoration process where full restoration, including the singlet sector, happens at significantly higher temperatures.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the symmetry strength parameters provide a model-independent benchmark for the analysis of symmetry breaking in QCD. It supports the hypothesis of a two-stage restoration of chiral and axial symmetries, with the nonsinglet sector restoring first, followed by the singlet sector at higher temperatures when topological fluctuations are suppressed.

Abstract: We introduce a renormalization-group invariant observable, the symmetry strength parameter $κ_{AB}$, for the quantitative characterization of symmetry breaking in QCD. As a first application, we employ $κ_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($κ_{PS}$), probing the $π$-$δ$ system; the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($κ_{VA}$), probing the $ρ$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($κ_{TX}$), probing the $ρ$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $κ_{PS} > κ_{TX} \sim κ_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels. These results support a two-stage restoration scenario, in which full symmetry restoration -- including the singlet sector -- occurs only at significantly higher temperatures once topological fluctuations are suppressed.
