### [1] [Phase structure analysis of 2d lattice CP(1) model with $θ$ term using tensor renormalization group method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06624)
*Hayato Aizawa,Shinji Takeda,Yusuke Yoshimura*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the phase structure of a 2D lattice CP(1) model with a θ term, particularly along the θ=π line. It uses an improved tensor renormalization group method to avoid the sign problem and to identify the critical region and its universality class, which is found to be the SU(2)ₖ₌₁ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

Motivation: The motivation is to non-perturbatively explore the phase structure of a 2D lattice CP(1) model with a θ term, especially around the θ=π line, where a critical region is expected. The authors aim to overcome the sign problem that typically complicates such studies and to determine the characteristics of the critical region, including the onset and the universality class.

Method: The method involves the use of an enhanced tensor renormalization group (TRG) approach. Two key improvements are introduced: the refinement of the initial tensor through a quadrature method for better accuracy, and the analysis of the phase structure using conformal field theory data, specifically the central charge and scaling dimensions, which can be effectively obtained by TRG.

Result: The results show the identification of the critical region's onset at βc=0.5952(8). Furthermore, it is determined that the universality class of the system corresponds to the SU(2)ₖ₌₁ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies the critical region and its universality class in the 2D lattice CP(1) model with a θ term. The findings support the theoretical expectations and provide a more accurate understanding of the phase structure, thanks to the improvements in the tensor renormalization group method.

Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of a two-dimensional lattice CP(1) model
with a $\theta$ term. In particular, we aim to identify a critical region
expected to exist along a $\theta=\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure
non-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor
renormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous
tensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial
tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves
higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement
consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the
conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions,
which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group
method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the
critical region, $\beta_{\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the
SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

### [2] [Non-singlet vector current in lattice QCD: $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improvement from large volumes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06869)
*Tim Harris,Harvey B. Meyer*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper updates the analysis of mass-independent vector improvement coefficients for non-singlet vector currents using a new estimate of the mass-dependent axial current improvement coefficient, and validates these results with additional ensembles. The new estimate improves consistency across different chiral trajectories and with previous small volume determinations in the massless limit.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to refine the understanding of the O(a)-improvement for non-singlet vector currents by incorporating a more accurate estimate of the mass-dependent axial current improvement coefficient, which was not available during the earlier study, and to ensure that the results are consistent across different conditions.

Method: The authors use a new estimate for the mass-dependent improvement coefficient (bar{b}_{mathrm{A}}^mathrm{eff}) and re-analyze the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients (c_{mathrm{V}} and c_{tilde{mathrm{V}}}) for both local and point-split discretizations. They also analyze additional ensembles with a different chiral trajectory to validate their findings at two values of the bare coupling.

Result: The results show that the use of the new estimate for bar{b}_{mathrm{A}}^mathrm{eff} leads to improved consistency between the two chiral trajectories and with a previous determination of the improvement coefficients in the massless limit on smaller volumes. This suggests that the updated analysis provides a more reliable description of the O(a)-improvement for non-singlet vector currents.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that updating the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients with the new estimate of the mass-dependent axial current improvement coefficient enhances the consistency and reliability of the O(a)-improvement framework for non-singlet vector currents. This update is important for achieving more precise lattice QCD calculations.

Abstract: In previous work, we determined the improvement coefficients $c_\mathrm{V}$
and $c_{\tilde{\mathrm{V}}}$ required for the massless
$\mathrm{O}(a)$-improvement of the local and point-split discretizations of the
non-singlet vector current for $N_\mathrm{f}=3$ non-perturbatively
$\mathrm{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions and the L\"uscher-Weisz gauge action,
using ensembles of large-volume configurations generated by the Coordinated
Lattice Simulations (CLS) initiative. A new estimate for the mass-dependent
improvement coefficient $\bar{b}_{\mathrm{A}}^\mathrm{eff}$ has recently become
available, differing from the one used in our earlier study, and on which our
implementation via a massive axial Ward identity relied. Here, we update our
analysis of the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients based on the
new axial current improvement coefficient, and analyse additional ensembles
with a different chiral trajectory in order to validate our results at two
values of the bare coupling. We find that using the new estimate of
$\bar{b}_{\mathrm{A}}^\mathrm{eff}$ improves the consistency between the two
chiral trajectories, as well as with a previous determination of the
improvement coefficients directly in the massless limit on small volumes.
