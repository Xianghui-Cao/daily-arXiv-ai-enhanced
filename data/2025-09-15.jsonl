Solving the Hermitian positive definite\nsystems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative\nmethods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and\ncomputationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this\nprocess, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However,\nconstructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional\ncomputational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a\nframework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as\neffective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit\nmatrices from either the original linear systems or the produced\npreconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG\nsolver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1\nspacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning\nscheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and\napproximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in\nrelevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a\ngeneral mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot\nlearning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field\nconfigurations of different sizes."}

SpM solves inverse problems by\nconsidering only the sparsity of the target solution. To assess the\napplicability of the method, we first test it with mock data that mimic\ncharmonium correlation functions. We show that, while resonance peaks in the\nspectral functions can be reconstructed using this method, it is difficult to\nreconstruct transport peaks without further assumptions beyond SpM. Then we\nextract charmonium spectral functions from correlation functions obtained from\nlattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature. We show\nthat this method yields results qualitatively consistent with those obtained\nusing the maximum entropy method, although the transport peak is not obtained\nclearly. This suggests that the results solely from the assumption of the\nsparse solution can partially reflect underlying physics."}
