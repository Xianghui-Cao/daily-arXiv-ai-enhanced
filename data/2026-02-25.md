Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the first lattice calculation of a two-to-two particle matrix element of a local current using a pionless effective field theory. It explores the effects on deep and shallow bound states, constrains infinite-volume amplitudes, and maps finite-volume matrix elements to scattering amplitudes, ultimately finding good agreement with predictions from the anomalous threshold in the case of shallow bound states.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and calculate the two-to-two particle matrix element of a local current within a lattice framework, specifically using a pionless effective field theory, in order to understand its behavior in both deep and shallow bound states, and to relate these findings to the form factors and scattering amplitudes.

Method: The method involves an exploratory lattice calculation using a leading-order pionless effective field theory for two nucleons in a finite 3D volume. The Hamiltonian is exactly diagonalized for moderate volumes, and the Lüscher formalism is used to constrain the infinite-volume hadronic amplitude. Finite-volume matrix elements are then mapped to scattering amplitudes via a current insertion, and a relation is used to constrain the infinite-volume form factor.

Result: The results show that for deep bound states, the finite-volume formalism is not necessary, whereas for shallow bound states it is critical. The charge radius of the bound state is determined, and there is good agreement with the prediction from the anomalous threshold in the shallow bound state limit.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the finite-volume lattice calculation can be effectively used to analyze two-to-two particle matrix elements and to determine the charge radius of the bound state. The study confirms the importance of the finite-volume formalism for shallow bound states and validates the use of the anomalous threshold for predicting the behavior of such systems.

Abstract: This work presents the first lattice calculation of a two-to-two particle matrix element of a local current. This exploratory calculation is performed using a leading-order pionless effective field theory of two nucleons in a finite 3D spatial volume, where the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly for moderate volumes. By considering a range of couplings where the theory supports a deuteron-like bound state, we determine the finite-volume spectra and matrix elements of the conserved local vector current. Using the Lüscher formalism, we constrain the infinite-volume, purely hadronic amplitude for this theory. Using previously derived formalism, we then map the finite-volume matrix elements to scattering amplitudes describing a reaction coupling two-particle states via a current insertion, $\2+\Jc \to \2$. We then use a recently derived relation between this class of amplitudes and the bound-state elastic form factor to directly constrain the infinite-volume form factor. By varying over a range of values of the coupling of the theory, we explore the effects of this analysis for deep-bound states and shallow-bound states. We reproduce the expected result that for deep bound states, the finite-volume formalism is largely unnecessary, while for shallow bound states, it is absolutely critical to obtain a sensible result. We present a detailed outline of the analysis of this class of matrix elements, including the determination of the charge radius of the bound state. In the shallow bound state limit, we find good agreement with the prediction stemming from the anomalous threshold.

### [2] [Lattice Gauge Theory via LLVM-Level Automatic Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20516)
*Yuki Nagai,Akio Tomiya,Hiroshi Ohno*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for automatically constructing Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) forces in lattice gauge theory using reverse-mode automatic differentiation on optimized LLVM intermediate representation, which can be applied to any language that compiles to LLVM. The approach allows for the generation of HMC forces directly from the action evaluation code, without the need for separate force routines, and demonstrates performance comparable to hand-written implementations for Wilson fermion actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to streamline the process of generating HMC forces in lattice gauge theory by automating it through reverse-mode automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating the need for manually maintaining separate force routines and enabling a single-source workflow that benefits from compiler optimizations.

Method: The method involves performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation on the LLVM intermediate representation of the action evaluation routine, which is then used to automatically generate the HMC forces. This technique is applied to both gauge and Wilson fermion actions, and the resulting forces are tested for their performance on both CPU and GPU backends.

Result: The result is that the generated HMC forces, particularly for the Wilson fermion case, achieve performance that is comparable to hand-coded fermion force implementations, while also providing a practical way to construct performance-portable forces for compositional lattice actions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the automatic construction of HMC forces through reverse-mode automatic differentiation at the LLVM IR level is a viable and efficient alternative to manual coding, offering a performance-portable solution that can be integrated into a single-source workflow.

Abstract: We enable the automatic construction of Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) forces in lattice gauge theory by performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation at the level of optimized LLVM intermediate representation, making the approach applicable to any language that lowers lattice action code to LLVM. In practice, this means that once the action evaluation routine is implemented, the corresponding HMC force can be generated automatically from the same code path, without deriving or maintaining a separate force routine. The method preserves conventional imperative, in-place implementations and enables a single-source workflow in which forces are generated directly from the action code while inheriting compiler optimizations. We perform end-to-end reverse-mode differentiation of both gauge and Wilson fermion actions. For the Wilson fermion case, we find that the force generated by automatic differentiation achieves performance comparable to a conventional hand-written fermion force implementation. The same differentiation pipeline targets both CPU and GPU backends, providing a practical route to performance-portable force construction for compositional lattice actions.

### [3] [Importance of local tetraquark operators for $T_{cc}(3875)^+$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20848)
*Andres Stump,Jeremy R. Green*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of including local tetraquark operators in the variational analysis for determining the finite-volume spectrum of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ particle, which results in significant shifts in energy level estimates and affects the $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately determine the finite-volume spectrum of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, a comprehensive variational analysis is required, and the inclusion of local tetraquark operators may be crucial for obtaining precise results.

Method: The researchers used Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point and performed calculations within the distillation framework. They added local tetraquark operators to a basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators, employing a position-space sampling method that makes the use of local tetraquark operators feasible with distillation.

Result: The inclusion of local tetraquark operators led to significant shifts in the estimated energy levels of the $T_{cc}$ spectrum. These changes also affected the $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts as determined by a single-channel $s$-wave Lüscher analysis.

Conclusion: Local tetraquark operators are important for the accurate determination of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ finite-volume spectrum, and their inclusion can lead to more reliable estimates of energy levels and scattering phase shifts.

Abstract: The doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed at LHCb has attracted considerable interest in recent years. To accurately determine its finite-volume spectrum, a variational analysis using a large basis of operators, including bilocal scattering operators, but also local tetraquark operators, should be employed. Using Wilson-clover fermions at the $SU(3)$-flavour-symmetric point, we investigated the importance of local tetraquark operators for the $T_{cc}$ spectrum by adding them to a large basis of bilocal $DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ scattering operators. We performed this calculation using the distillation framework combined with a position-space sampling method that we recently developed. This method makes local tetraquark operators affordable in distillation. Upon including local tetraquark operators, we observe significant shifts in the estimates of several energy levels. Finally, we show the effect of these shifts on the $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts obtained from a single-channel $s$-wave Lüscher analysis.

### [4] [Spatial confinement-deconfinement transition in accelerated gluodynamics within lattice simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20970)
*Viktor Braguta,Vladimir Goy,Jayanta Dey,Artem Roenko*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of weak acceleration on the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics using lattice simulation. It finds that this transition becomes a spatial crossover in Rindler spacetime, suggesting coexistence of both phases within specific temperature and acceleration ranges. The boundary between these phases aligns well with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the critical temperature remains unchanged compared to standard homogeneous gluodynamics, implying such a transition might occur near a Schwarzschild black hole horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how weak acceleration affects the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics, potentially revealing insights into the behavior of such transitions under non-inertial conditions and their relevance to phenomena near black holes.

Method: Lattice simulations were conducted in the comoving reference frame of an accelerated observer, described by Rindler coordinates, to analyze the phase transition's behavior under weak acceleration.

Result: The finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition transforms into a spatial crossover in Rindler spacetime, allowing for the coexistence of confinement and deconfinement phases within certain temperature and acceleration intervals. The boundary between these phases is determined and found to follow the Tolman-Ehrenfest law closely, with minor deviations. The critical temperature for the system in the weak acceleration regime stays the same as in standard homogeneous gluodynamics.

Conclusion: Weak acceleration leads to a spatial crossover in the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in Rindler spacetime, indicating the possibility of a similar transition near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. This finding underscores the robustness of the critical temperature against weak accelerations and highlights the applicability of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in describing the phase boundary.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of weak acceleration on the confinement-deconfinement phase transition in gluodynamics. Our study is carried out within lattice simulation in the comoving reference frame of accelerated observer which is parameterized by the Rindler coordinates. We find that finite temperature confinement-deconfinement phase transition turns into spatial crossover in the Rindler spacetime. In other words, spatially separated confinement and deconfinement phases can coexist in the Rindler spacetime within certain intervals of temperature and acceleration. We determine the position of the boundary between the phases as a function of temperature for several accelerations and find that it can be described by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law with rather good accuracy although a minor deviation takes place. Moreover, the critical temperature of the system in the weak acceleration regime is found to remain unchanged as that of the standard homogeneous gluodynamics. Our results imply that the spatial confinement-deconfinement transition might take place in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black hole horizon.

*Marko Maležič,Johann Ostmeyer*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of higher-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes for more efficient simulation of Hamiltonian lattice field theories, presenting new optimized schemes and demonstrating their performance on the Heisenberg model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of simulating real-time dynamics in lattice field theories by exploring and optimizing higher-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, which are crucial for time evolution computation both on quantum and classical hardware.

Method: The authors outline a guide to Trotter-Suzuki schemes, introduce new efficient schemes discovered through an optimization framework, and evaluate their performance using the Heisenberg model as a case study.

Result: The results show that the newly found efficient Trotter-Suzuki schemes can potentially lead to more effective simulations of lattice field theories, with demonstrated improvements when applied to the Heisenberg model.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that higher-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, when properly optimized, can offer significant advantages in the computational efficiency of simulating Hamiltonian systems, particularly within the context of the Heisenberg model.

Abstract: Hamiltonian formulations of lattice field theories provide access to real-time dynamics, but their simulation is difficult to implement efficiently. Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are at the center of time evolution computation, either on quantum hardware or classically, for instance with the use of tensor networks. While low-order Trotterizations remain the standard choice due to their simplicity, higher-order schemes offer the potential for improved efficiency. In this work we outline a short guide to Trotter-Suzuki schemes and their implementations in general. To help with this, we highlight new efficient schemes found by our optimization framework, and demonstrate their performance on the Heisenberg model.
