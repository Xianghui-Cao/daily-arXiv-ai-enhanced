A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within\nthe Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit\nthe correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order\n$1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the\npossibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of\nthis paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov\nloop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By\nisolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the\nvalue $M/\\sqrt{\\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which\nis used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature\nbehaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture\nfor the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature\nregime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results\nfor Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by\napplying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two\ndimension, and find excellent agreement."}
