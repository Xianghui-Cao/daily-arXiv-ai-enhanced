  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of excited-state contamination which introduces significant systematic uncertainties in the precise measurement of hadron structure observables via lattice QCD. The aim is to provide both a theoretical understanding and practical solutions to mitigate these effects.

Method: A general mechanism is proposed, based on meson dominance, and it is implemented through the variational method. This approach helps in identifying which excited states are emphasized by the selection of the inserted current and kinematics conditions. The method's effectiveness is backed by numerical results and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across various hadronic channels, especially focusing on the nucleon sector.

Result: The results show that the proposed method can predict and control the excited-state contamination effectively. It provides evidence from numerical simulations and consistency with chiral perturbation theory, demonstrating its utility in reducing systematic errors in the analysis of hadron three-point functions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the presented mechanism offers a way to understand and manage excited-state contributions, thereby improving the accuracy of hadron structure calculations in lattice QCD. It suggests a practical approach for researchers to better control systematic uncertainties in their analyses.

Abstract: Excited-state contamination remains one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the precise determination of hadron structure observables from lattice QCD. In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a first lattice study of the doubly-charmed tetraquark T_cc^+ via a three-body approach, focusing on the DDπ system and incorporating two- and three-body effects. Preliminary results for subchannels are presented, and an exploratory analysis of three-body spectra is performed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct the first lattice study of the doubly-charmed tetraquark T_cc^+ using a three-body approach, aiming to investigate the DDπ system in the I=0, C=2 sector, and to incorporate both two- and three-body effects, as well as left-hand cuts due to single π exchanges.

Method: A three-body approach is used to study the DDπ system, with two CLS ensembles (X252 and X253) at pion mass M_π ≈ 280 MeV. The method employs an operator set including two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs, such as amplitudes for the I=1 DD and I=1/2 Dπ two-body subsystems, are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis.

Result: Preliminary results for the I=1 DD and I=1/2 Dπ subchannels are obtained, and an exploratory determination of three-body spectra is conducted for simple choices of the three-particle K-matrix, allowing a preliminary comparison to the lattice spectrum.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for understanding the properties of the T_cc^+ tetraquark through a three-body lattice approach, which incorporates both two- and three-body dynamics, and it sets the stage for further detailed analyses by presenting initial results and comparisons to the lattice spectrum.

Abstract: We discuss an ongoing first lattice study of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$(3875) via a three-body approach. We investigate the $DDπ$ system in the $I=0$, $C=2$ sector, where the $T_{cc}^+$ appears as a pole in the $J^P = 1^+$ $DDπ$ elastic scattering amplitude. The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DDπ$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $π$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_π\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $Dπ$ two-body subsystems. We present preliminary results for these subchannels and perform exploratory three-body spectra determinations for simple choices of the three-particle K-matrix $\mathcal{K}_{\text{df}, 3}$, allowing a first comparison to the lattice spectrum.

### [3] [Quarkonium in non-zero isospin chemical potential environment at $T \simeq 0$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17232)
*Seyong Kim,Bastian B. Brandt,Gergely Endrődi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of isospin asymmetry on quarkonium states, particularly bottom quark correlators, using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD. It reports that at high isospin chemical potential, the Upsilon mass increases, while at lower potentials, the effect on the Upsilon mass is non-monotonic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how isospin asymmetry affects quarkonium states in QCD, especially at near zero temperature, which can provide insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions and the properties of heavy quark bound states.

Method: The method involves using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) to calculate bottom quark correlators from gauge field ensembles with different isospin chemical potentials and constructing S- and P-wave quarkonium state correlators. The study uses a 32^3 x 48 lattice with specified parameters for the isospin chemical potential and current strength.

Result: The results indicate that at the highest isospin chemical potential (μ_I a = 0.106), the Upsilon meson mass becomes heavier compared to its vacuum value. For lower isospin chemical potentials, the effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic, suggesting a complex interplay between isospin asymmetry and quarkonium states.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the preliminary results is that isospin asymmetry has a significant and non-trivial effect on the Upsilon meson mass, with the mass increasing at higher isospin chemical potential but exhibiting a more complicated pattern at lower values.

Abstract: We study how the isospin asymmetry affects quarkonium states in QCD at near zero temperature. Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $μ_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $μ_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $λa = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_π= 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $μ_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $μ_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic.
