### [1] [The phases of QCD reached in terrestrial and cosmic colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21108)
*Sourendu Gupta*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper reviews the current understanding of the QCD phase diagram, focusing on recent advancements in lattice techniques and their implications for exploring new aspects of the phase diagram. It also discusses the reconstruction of the full phase diagram for physical QCD and touches upon the relevance to neutron star cores and the chiral transition in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide an updated review of the QCD phase diagram, incorporating the latest findings from lattice simulations and discussing their impact on our understanding of QCD under various conditions, including those relevant to neutron stars.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on the QCD phase diagram, with a particular emphasis on lattice QCD results for $N_f=2+1$. They also explore how these results can be applied to reconstruct the phase diagram for the physically relevant case of $N_f=1+1+1$ and discuss the implications for matter in neutron star cores and the chiral transition in the context of the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.

Result: The review highlights the progress made in mapping sections of the QCD phase diagram with high precision for $N_f=2+1$, and it outlines the potential to extend this knowledge to the full phase diagram for physical QCD. The discussion includes the challenges and computational needs for furthering our understanding, as well as the constraints on the matter within neutron star cores.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by summarizing the current state of research on the QCD phase diagram, emphasizing the importance of ongoing and future lattice studies for advancing our knowledge. It also points out the areas where additional research is needed to fully understand the QCD phase structure and its application to astrophysical phenomena like neutron stars.

Abstract: We review the current state of knowledge of the phase diagram of QCD through lattice, effective field theories, and chiral models. Several sections through the three dimensional phase diagram are known for $N_f=2+1$ with good precision. Due to technical advances in lattice techniques over the last decade or so, new aspects of the phase diagram can now be explored. We review current lattice results. The newly acquired knowledge can be used to reconstruct the full phase diagram for physical QCD, \ie, $N_f=1+1+1$. We remark on the computations which would help understand this better, and what the current constraints are on matter in neutron star cores. We also remark on the physics of the chiral transition and neutron stars in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ limit.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The Fredenhagen-Marcu operator is evaluated as a potential order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields, and it successfully distinguishes between the deconfinement, Higgs, and confinement phases.

Motivation: To investigate if the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can be used to identify the deconfinement phase transition in gauge-matter systems at finite temperature, specifically within the context of (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory that includes Z(2)-valued Higgs fields.

Method: Numerical simulations were conducted to compute the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields.

Result: The Fredenhagen-Marcu operator was found to effectively serve as an order parameter, allowing the distinction of the deconfinement phase from both the Higgs and confinement phases of the theory.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator is a valid order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition, capable of differentiating between the deconfinement, Higgs, and confinement phases in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory with Higgs fields.

Abstract: We explore the possibility to use the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator as an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in gauge-matter systems at finite temperature. Concretely, we compute by numerical simulations this operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields. Our conclusion is that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can indeed serve as an order parameter capable of distinguishing the deconfinement phase from the Higgs and confinement phases of the theory.
