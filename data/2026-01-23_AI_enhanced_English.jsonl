The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $\u03bc=0$ to $\u03bc=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the QCD phase transition in the heavy quark, high-density region using an effective theory with dynamical Polyakov loops.

Classical computers generally fail to reproduce accurate results when it comes to strongly coupled theories such as QCD. Recent developments in quantum technologies open up the possibility of simulating such physical regimes by using quantum computers. In this paper, we study the quantum resource related to the simulability of a quantum theory, i.e. non-stabilizerness for Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete symmetry gauge groups.

Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups.
