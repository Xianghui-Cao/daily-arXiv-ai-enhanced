TL;DR: The paper explores efficient methods for preparing approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware, using a refined irrep truncation method and ansatz circuits. It compares variational and adiabatic state preparation, and introduces hybrid methods. The authors also release two software packages, ymcirc and pyclebsch, to aid in the construction of $SU(3)$ circuits and computation of $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop more efficient techniques for simulating $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theories on quantum computers, which could reduce the complexity of simulations and make them more feasible with current and near-future quantum hardware.

Method: The authors use a variant of the electric basis and introduce a refined irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets. They employ strong-coupling perturbation theory to design simple ansatz circuits and test these through classical simulation on small lattices. They also compare variational and adiabatic state preparation methods and propose a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both.

Result: The study finds that the proposed refinement of irrep truncation offers a finer gradation of simulation complexity, and the ansatz circuits show promising results for ground state preparation. The comparison between variational and adiabatic methods reveals trade-offs in terms of state fidelities and resource requirements, leading to the development of a hybrid method. Additionally, the public release of the ymcirc and pyclebsch software packages provides tools for the community to build upon this work.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the refined irrep truncation and ansatz circuit design can effectively prepare approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. The hybridization of variational and adiabatic methods offers a practical approach to state preparation, and the provided software packages are expected to facilitate further research and applications in the field.

Abstract: We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of
$SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the
electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the
energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation
complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop
simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical
simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in
$d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource
requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and
introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on
the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building
$SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a
package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

### [2] [Equation of State of QCD with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electroweak scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26064)
*Matteo Bresciani,Mattia Dalla Brida,Leonardo Giusti,Michele Pepe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-perturbative determination of the Equation of State (EoS) for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with three flavors, achieving a precision of 0.5% to 1.0% in the temperature range from 3 GeV to 165 GeV. The entropy density is computed and used to determine pressure and energy density. The results align well with the Stefan-Boltzmann limit at high temperatures and are consistent with perturbative QCD when including higher-order terms that account for non-perturbative effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a precise, non-perturbative calculation of the EoS for QCD with three quark flavors over a wide temperature range, which is essential for understanding the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in heavy-ion collisions or the early universe.

Method: The researchers performed lattice QCD simulations, computing the entropy density at multiple lattice spacings to extrapolate to the continuum limit. They then integrated the entropy density to find the pressure and energy density. The data were analyzed for their consistency with theoretical expectations, including the Stefan-Boltzmann limit and perturbative QCD predictions augmented with non-perturbative contributions.

Result: The numerical data obtained from the lattice QCD simulations show a linear dependence on the square of the strong coupling constant, suggesting an approach to the Stefan-Boltzmann limit at high temperatures. The findings also agree with a parametrization that combines perturbative QCD with higher-order, non-perturbative terms, and this agreement extends to lower temperatures, down to 500 MeV, when compared with other existing data.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust and accurate EoS for QCD with three flavors, demonstrating a smooth transition towards the Stefan-Boltzmann limit and confirming the validity of the perturbative QCD description when supplemented with non-perturbative corrections. The results offer a comprehensive dataset for the thermodynamic properties of QCD over a broad temperature range, which can be utilized in both theoretical and experimental studies.

Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is
determined non-perturbatively with a precision of about $0.5\%-1.0\%$ in the
range of temperatures between 3 GeV and 165 GeV. The computation is carried out
by numerical simulations of the gauge theory discretized on the lattice. At
each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice
spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The
pressure and energy density are then determined by integrating the entropy
density with respect to the temperature. The numerical data show a linear
behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared, which points to the
Stefan-Boltzmann limit at infinite temperature. They are also compatible with
the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the
coupling constant, containing non-perturbative contributions. This
parametrization describes well our data together with those present in the
literature down to 500 MeV.

TL;DR: This paper presents a lattice QCD calculation of the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function, incorporating first-order matching corrections, using two ensembles with different pion masses to support the determination of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to provide a non-perturbative evaluation of the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function, which are essential for determining the transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs) in high-energy physics. Accurate TMD PDFs are crucial for the analysis of various processes at hadron colliders, such as Drell-Yan lepton pair production and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.

Method: The authors use lattice QCD to calculate the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function, including O(Î±_s) matching corrections. The quasi-transverse momentum-dependent wave function and four-point meson form factors are evaluated using asymmetric staple-shaped quark bilinear operators. The computations are performed on two N_f=2+1+1 twisted-mass fermion ensembles, both with a lattice spacing of 0.093 fm but with different volumes and pion masses, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the lattice artifacts and finite volume effects.

Result: The results of the calculations provide numerical values for the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function, which can be used for the extraction of TMD PDFs. These outcomes are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the partonic structure of the proton and improve the precision of theoretical predictions in high-energy collision experiments.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the lattice QCD approach, with the inclusion of matching corrections, is a viable method for calculating the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function, which are key elements for the precise determination of TMD PDFs. The results obtained from the two different ensembles are consistent and pave the way for future studies with improved accuracy and a wider range of pion masses and lattice spacings.

Abstract: We evaluate the Collins-Soper kernel and the reduced soft function in lattice
QCD, incorporating $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ matching corrections. The
calculation relies on the evaluation of the quasi-transverse momentum-dependent
wave function with asymmetric staple-shaped quark bilinear operators and
four-point meson form factors. These quantities are computed non-perturbatively
using two $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted-mass fermion ensembles with the same lattice
spacing of $a=0.093$ fm: the first ensemble has a lattice size of $24^3 \times
48$ and a pion mass of 346 MeV; the second one has a lattice size of $32^3
\times 64$ and a pion mass of 261 MeV. The Collins-Soper kernel and the soft
function are needed for the determination of the transverse momentum-dependent
parton distribution functions.
