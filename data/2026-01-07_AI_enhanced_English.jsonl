Meyer"], "title": "The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Averaging Lattice QCD Results", "comment": "22 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Flagship neutrino oscillation experiments depend on precise and accurate theoretical knowledge of neutrino-nucleon cross sections across a variety of energies and interaction mechanisms. Key ingredients to the amplitudes that make up these cross sections are parameterized form factors. The axial form factor describing a weak interaction with a nucleon is part of one of the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction mechanisms, quasielastic scattering, yet this form factor is uncertain and its precision is limited by the availability of data for a neutrino scattering with nucleons or small nuclear targets. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) now offers another approach for obtaining mathematically rigorous constraints of the axial form factor from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets. In this work, strategies for averaging LQCD results are explored, including both a random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers as well as an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. Fits to z expansion parameterizations are reported and compared against neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores strategies for averaging Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) results to obtain more precise and accurate constraints on the axial form factor, a key component in understanding neutrino-nucleon interactions. The authors compare their fits to z expansion parameterizations against existing neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data.", "motivation": "The motivation of this paper is to improve the precision and accuracy of the theoretical knowledge of neutrino-nucleon cross sections, particularly focusing on the axial form factor which is crucial for quasielastic scattering. The current uncertainty in the axial form factor limits the precision of flagship neutrino oscillation experiments, and there is a need for mathematically rigorous constraints from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets.", "method": "The method involves exploring different strategies for averaging Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) results, including random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers and an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. The authors then fit these averaged results to z expansion parameterizations and compare them against experimental data from neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering.", "result": "The result of this work is the development of new fitting techniques that can be used to average LQCD results, leading to more reliable constraints on the axial form factor. These fits are compared against the experimental scattering data, providing a way to assess the validity and improvement over previous methods.", "conclusion": "The conclusion suggests that the use of LQCD and the proposed averaging strategies offer a promising approach to obtaining more precise and accurate constraints on the axial form factor. This, in turn, can lead to improved predictions for neutrino-nucleon cross sections and enhance the performance of neutrino oscillation experiments."}}

We demonstrate that the tensor renormalization group (TRG) offers an efficient framework to compute the symmetry-twisted partition functions, which enables us to detect the symmetry-breaking transition and also to study associated critical phenomena. As concrete examples of SSB, we investigate the two-dimensional (2D) classical Ising model and the three-dimensional (3D) classical $O(2)$ nonlinear sigma model, and we identify their critical points solely from the twisted partition function. By employing the finite-size scaling argument, we find the critical temperature $T_c=2.2017(2)$ with the critical exponent $\u03bd= 0.663(33)$ for the 3D $O(2)$ model. In addition, we also study the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) criticality of the 2D classical $O(2)$ model by extracting the helicity modulus from the twisted partition functions, and we obtain the BKT transition temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}=0.8928(2)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper uses the tensor renormalization group (TRG) to efficiently compute symmetry-twisted partition functions, which are used to detect symmetry-breaking transitions and study critical phenomena in 2D and 3D classical models.
