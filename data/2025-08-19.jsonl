The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the\nformalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of\na complex $\\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1\ndimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact\ninteraction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources."}
