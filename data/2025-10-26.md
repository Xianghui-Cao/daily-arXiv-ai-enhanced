TL;DR: This paper introduces a lattice QCD mixed action approach using Wilson-type quarks in both sea and valence sectors, with a focus on matching sea and valence quark masses. A precise universality test is performed by comparing the results of the mixed-action and unitary setups. The paper also presents a scale setting procedure based on pion, kaon, and gradient flow scale, leading to an improved determination of the physical value of $t_0$.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop and validate a mixed action lattice QCD approach that can be used for more accurate calculations in particle physics, particularly in improving the control over systematic uncertainties in the determination of physical quantities such as the gradient flow scale $t_0$.

Method: The method involves the use of gauge ensembles with 2+1 flavors of O($a$)-improved Wilson fermions in the sea sector, and Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist in the valence sector. The authors match the sea and valence quark masses along the renormalized chiral trajectory, and perform a universality test by comparing the continuum limit results from the mixed-action and unitary approaches. Additionally, they apply a scale setting procedure using pion and kaon masses and decay constants, and the gradient flow scale $t_0$.

Result: The result of this work is the successful application of the mixed-action approach, which shows consistency with the unitary setup. The combination of both methods leads to a more precise determination of the physical value of the gradient flow scale $t_0$, with better control over systematic uncertainties.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the research is that the mixed-action approach is a valid and effective method for lattice QCD simulations, providing a means to improve the accuracy of physical quantity determinations, such as the gradient flow scale, through the reduction of systematic uncertainties.

Abstract: We introduce a lattice QCD mixed action approach that employs Wilson-type
quarks in the sea and valence sectors. The sea sector is based on gauge
ensembles with $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved
Wilson fermions generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS)
initiative. The parameter space of the considered ensembles encompasses five
values of the lattice spacing, a range of pion masses extending down to the
physical point, and large physical volumes. In the valence sector, we employ
Wilson twisted-mass fermions at maximal twist, using the same massless
Wilson-Dirac operator in both the sea and valence sectors. We describe the
strategy applied for the required matching of the sea and valence quark masses
along the target renormalised chiral trajectory. A precise universality test is
then conducted by comparing the continuum-limit results of the mixed-action
approach and of the unitary setup, in which the same Wilson fermion
regularisation is employed in the sea and in the valence. As a key application,
we conduct a scale setting procedure based on lattice determinations of the
masses and decay constants of the pion and kaon, as well as the gradient flow
scale $t_0$. The scale setting can consequently be performed in three distinct
ways, utilising the unitary setup, the mixed action approach, and their
combination. We observe that the latter combination results in enhanced control
of the systematic uncertainties, thereby yielding a precise determination of
the physical value of $t_0$.
