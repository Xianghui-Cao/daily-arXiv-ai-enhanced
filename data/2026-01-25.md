### [1] [Phase structure of lattice QCD in the heavy quark high-density region and the three-state Potts model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15720)
*Shinji Ejiri,Masanari Koiida,Toshiki Sato*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the QCD phase transition in the heavy quark, high-density region using an effective theory with Polyakov loops as dynamic variables. By modeling it as a 3D three-state Potts model, the authors use finite volume scaling and tensor renormalization group to find evidence of a first-order phase transition at both low and high densities, with a crossover at a critical point.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the fundamental properties of the QCD phase transition in the context of heavy quarks and high density, by investigating the role of $Z_3$ symmetry breaking through the behavior of the Polyakov loop.

Method: The method involves replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin to formulate the problem as a 3D three-state Potts model, and then analyzing the phase structure using finite volume scaling and tensor renormalization group techniques, especially in regions where the sign problem is significant.

Result: The results show that the phase transition is first order at low density, changes to a crossover at a certain critical point, and then becomes first order again at high density, suggesting the existence of a first-order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that there is strong evidence for a first-order phase transition in the high-density region of QCD with heavy quarks, which has implications for our understanding of the QCD phase diagram.

Abstract: We discuss the nature of the QCD phase transition in the heavy quark high-density region by considering an effective theory in which Polyakov loops are dynamical variables. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.

### [2] [Magic of discrete lattice gauge theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15842)
*Gianluca Esposito,Simone Cepollaro,Luigi Cappiello,Alioscia Hamma*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of quantum computers to simulate Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs) with discrete symmetry gauge groups, focusing on the non-stabilizerness as a key quantum resource. It finds that enforcing gauge constraints for Z_l LGTs does not increase this resource and discusses the relationship between the non-abelian nature of the gauge group and the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of classical computers in simulating strongly coupled theories, such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), by leveraging recent advancements in quantum technologies that could potentially more accurately simulate these physical systems using quantum computers.

Method: The method involves studying the quantum resource, specifically non-stabilizerness, related to the simulability of Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete symmetry gauge groups. The researchers analyze the impact of enforcing gauge constraints on this resource and explore how the non-abelian characteristics of the gauge group influence the non-stabilizerness of the gauge invariant Hilbert space.

Result: The results indicate that imposing gauge constraints for Z_l Lattice Gauge Theories does not add to the non-stabilizerness, which is a positive outcome for efficient simulation. Additionally, the study reveals a connection between the non-abelian properties of the gauge group and the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space, suggesting that the structure of the gauge group plays a role in the complexity of the quantum simulation.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the research is that the non-stabilizerness, a measure of quantum resources needed for simulation, is not affected by the imposition of gauge constraints in Z_l Lattice Gauge Theories. This finding, along with the observed relation to the non-abelian nature of the gauge group, contributes to the understanding of the requirements for simulating such theories on quantum computers.

Abstract: Simulation of quantum field theories and fundamental interactions are one of the most challenging tasks in modern particle physics. Classical computers generally fail to reproduce accurate results when it comes to strongly coupled theories such as QCD. Recent developments in quantum technologies open up the possibility of simulating such physical regimes by using quantum computers. In this paper, we study the quantum resource related to the simulability of a quantum theory, i.e. non-stabilizerness for Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete symmetry gauge groups. We show that enforcing gauge constraints for $\mathbb{Z}_l$ LGTs has no cost in terms of this resource and discuss the relation between non-abelianity of the gauge group with the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge invariant Hilbert space.

### [3] [Critical scaling in the $N=1$ Thirring Model in $(2+1)d$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16051)
*Simon Hands,Jude Worthy*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study explores the Thirring model in 2+1 dimensions, focusing on spontaneous symmetry breaking with N Dirac flavors. Using Wilson kernel domain wall fermions, simulations for N=1 are conducted and show critical exponents that align with analytic predictions, suggesting a UV-stable renormalization group fixed point. Preliminary results for N=2 are also discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the spontaneous U(2N) to U(N)⊗U(N) symmetry breaking through fermion-antifermion condensation in the Thirring model, especially in the limit as mass approaches zero, and to determine the critical exponents and the existence of a UV-stable fixed point.

Method: The method involves using Wilson kernel domain wall fermions for numerical simulations on a lattice with dimensions 16^3×L_s, where L_s ranges from 24 to 120. The bilinear condensate <ψψ̄> is analyzed as a function of coupling and bare mass, and the data is extrapolated to infinite L_s and fitted to an empirical equation of state.

Result: The result is that the critical exponents obtained from the simulations for N=1 differ significantly from previous values and now match those predicted by approximate solutions to Schwinger-Dyson equations, which is consistent with the presence of a UV-stable renormalization group fixed point. Preliminary results for N=2 are presented but not fully analyzed.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the new simulation results for the Thirring model with N=1 support the existence of a UV-stable fixed point, and further investigation with N=2 is needed to explore the non-perturbative issue of the value N_c below which such a fixed point exists.

Abstract: The Thirring model in 2+1$d$ with $N$ Dirac flavors can exhibit spontaneous U($2N)\to$U($N)\otimes$U($N$) breaking through fermion - antifermion condensation in the limit $m\to0$. With no small parameter in play the symmetry-breaking dynamics is strongly-interacting and quantitative work requires a fermion formulation accurately capturing global symmetries. We present simulation results for $N=1$ obtained with Wilson kernel domain wall fermions on $16^3\times L_s$, with $L_s=24,\ldots,120$. The $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation of the bilinear condensate $\langle\barψψ\rangle$ as a function of coupling and bare mass is fitted to an empirical equation of state; the resulting critical exponents are significantly altered from previously obtained values, and for the first time resemble those emerging from analytic predictions based on approximate solutions to Schwinger-Dyson equations, consistent with a putative UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. To address the non-perturbative issue of the value $N_c$ below which such a fixed point exists we present preliminary results obtained with $N=2$.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper uses tensor network simulations to study the behavior of flux strings in a 2+1D QED model with a spin-1 gauge field, revealing new microscopic processes for string breaking and glueball formation. The research provides insights into quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit, including efficient qudit circuits for ion-trap experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of flux strings in lattice formulations of gauge theories, particularly in higher truncations of the gauge field, which are more relevant to the quantum field theory limit than the commonly studied lower truncations. This is important for advancing the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP).

Method: The method involves using tensor network simulations to analyze the ground-state phase diagram of a 2+1D QED model with a spin-1 representation of the gauge field. The researchers also examine out-of-equilibrium dynamics by starting from different initial product state string configurations and performing quenches across various parameter regimes. Additionally, they propose efficient qudit circuits suitable for implementation in state-of-the-art ion-trap quantum simulation setups.

Result: The results include the identification of distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, such as a two-stage breaking mechanism that is not observed in the spin-1/2 formulation. The study also demonstrates real-time string breaking and the formation of glueball-like bound states, phenomena that are not possible in the spin-1/2 case. The research provides insights into the non-equilibrium dynamics of flux strings and suggests experimental setups for observing these effects in quantum simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study advances the understanding of flux strings in a 2+1D QED model with a spin-1 gauge field, providing new insights into string breaking mechanisms and the formation of glueball-like states. The proposed qudit circuits offer a pathway for future experimental studies in ion-trap quantum simulators, paving the way for further exploration of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.

Abstract: At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.
