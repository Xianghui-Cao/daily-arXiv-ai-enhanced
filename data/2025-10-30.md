*Navya Gupta,Christopher David White,Zohreh Davoudi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to use variational ansatz families and optimize them with Monte-Carlo data for state preparation in quantum field theories, which can be efficiently implemented into quantum circuits with polynomial gate complexity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of preparing non-trivial initial states in quantum simulators, which are used to study real-time dynamics of quantum field theories. The authors aim to bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions by utilizing classical information from Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods.

Method: The method involves proposing variational ansatz families that match ground-state energies but have different correlations and local non-Gaussianity. These ansatzes are then optimized using selected wavefunction moments derived from Monte-Carlo data, which allows for efficient translation into quantum circuits with a gate complexity that scales polynomially with system size.

Result: The result is a set of variational ansatzes that, when optimized with Monte-Carlo data, can be effectively translated into quantum circuits. The gate complexity of these circuits scales polynomially with the system size, making the approach scalable for larger systems.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed method paves the way for leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in quantum field theories, which is a significant step towards the practical application of quantum simulators in studying complex physical systems.

Abstract: Quantum simulators hold great promise for studying real-time (Minkowski)
dynamics of quantum field theories. Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial
states remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield
ground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle,
guide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to
bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting
scalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve
comparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local
non-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo
data, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum
circuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity
scales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically
leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in
quantum field theories of interest in nature.

### [2] [Isotensor $πππ$ scattering with a $ρ$ resonant subsystem from QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894)
*Raúl A. Briceño,Maxwell T. Hansen,Andrew W. Jackura,Robert G. Edwards,Christopher E. Thomas*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a lattice QCD study of pi-pi-pi scattering in the isospin-2, J^P = 1+ channel, using unphysically heavy quark masses and finite-volume methods to determine infinite-volume scattering amplitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a non-perturbative determination of three-pion scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2, J^P = 1+ channel, which can be used to understand the dynamics of strong interactions at low energies, particularly the role of the narrow rho meson resonance.

Method: The method involves using lattice QCD with unphysically heavy light-quark masses, analyzing the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems, and solving coupled integral equations to extract infinite-volume scattering amplitudes from the constrained K matrix elements.

Result: The results include the determination of the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix and the corresponding scattering amplitudes, obtained by combining data from two-pion systems and new calculations for the three-pion system across different lattice volumes.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the presented lattice QCD approach successfully provides a way to calculate the pi-pi-pi scattering amplitudes in the specified channel, offering insights into the behavior of the rho meson as a narrow resonance and contributing to the understanding of multi-hadron interactions.

Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of
$\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular
momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using
unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi}
\approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance.
The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively
relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their
infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results
for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the
isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic
lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$.
These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the
infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled
integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.

### [3] [Universal Features of Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Large-$N$ QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25644)
*Claudio Bonanno,Margarita García Pérez,Antonio González-Arroyo,Ken-Ichi Ishikawa,Masanori Okawa,Dario Panfalone*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the universal characteristics of chiral symmetry breaking in large-$N$ QCD by comparing non-perturbative data on the low-lying Dirac spectrum with predictions from chiral Random Matrix Theory, using numerical Monte Carlo simulations and a chiral lattice discretization. The study reaches up to $N=841$ and determines the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is then compared with a previous result obtained using a different quark model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking in large-$N$ Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) by matching non-perturbative lattice results with theoretical predictions from chiral Random Matrix Theory (RMT).

Method: The authors use a chiral lattice discretization of the Dirac operator and perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations, employing twisted volume reduction to achieve very high values of $N$. They compare their findings with RMT predictions to extract the large-$N$ chiral condensate.

Result: The researchers successfully extracted the large-$N$ chiral condensate from their lattice data, which they matched with RMT predictions. This value was also compared with a recent determination that used non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted volume-reduced models, providing a consistency check between different approaches.

Conclusion: The study confirms the applicability of chiral Random Matrix Theory for predicting the low-lying Dirac spectrum in large-$N$ QCD and provides a consistent determination of the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is in agreement with results from other quark models.

Abstract: We investigate the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking in
large-$N$ QCD by comparing non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying
Dirac spectrum with chiral Random Matrix Theory (RMT) predictions. Our
numerical Monte Carlo calculations are based on a chiral lattice discretization
of the Dirac operator, and exploit twisted volume reduction to reach $N$ as
large as 841. Matching lattice data with RMT analytic results, we are able to
extract the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is compared with a recent
determination obtained with non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted
volume-reduced models.

*Claudio Bonanno,Andrea Bulgarelli,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada,Dario Panfalone,Davide Vadacchino,Lorenzo Verzichelli*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new methodology using out-of-equilibrium simulations and open boundary conditions to reduce topological freezing in lattice gauge theories, with a detailed cost analysis for the 4D SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, and proposes an advanced Stochastic Normalizing Flow technique for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of topological freezing that occurs when approaching the continuum limit in lattice gauge theories, which hinders efficient sampling of the topological charge.

Method: The method involves out-of-equilibrium simulations with open boundary conditions and a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach where periodic boundary conditions are gradually introduced. The authors also develop a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolving boundary conditions.

Result: The results show that the proposed methods can effectively reduce autocorrelation of the topological charge and enable more efficient sampling even at very small lattice spacings (0.045 fm). The Stochastic Normalizing Flow provides better performance compared to the purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the developed strategy offers a clear path to efficiently sample topology in the continuum limit, with the potential for further improvements through flow-based solutions.

Abstract: We develop a methodology based on out-of-equilibrium simulations to mitigate
topological freezing when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge
theories. We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing
open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using
a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions
are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational
costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$
Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a
clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we
check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this
approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions
in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the
purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more
efficient future flow-based solutions.
