A new approach to this\nproblem based on Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation has been proposed by Bergamaschi\net al. Here we extend their method by exploring the propagation of the\nstatistical and systematic errors that accompany a lattice QCD calculation\nthrough this interpolation process. A simplified example of a multiparticle\nspectral function is studied with a focus on the possible applications of these\nmethods to the calculation of inclusive heavy-particle decays.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the propagation of statistical and systematic errors in lattice QCD calculations for multiparticle production, using Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation, with a focus on its application to heavy-particle decays.", "motivation": "The challenge of calculating inclusive processes involving many particles in lattice QCD, which is a Euclidean-space method not well-suited for real-time, multiparticle production, motivates the exploration of new methods such as Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation to improve accuracy and applicability.", "method": "The authors extend the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation method proposed by Bergamaschi et al. by studying the propagation of statistical and systematic errors through the interpolation process, using a simplified example of a multiparticle spectral function.", "result": "The study provides insights into how errors propagate through the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation process, potentially aiding in more accurate predictions of multiparticle production, especially in the context of inclusive heavy-particle decays.", "conclusion": "The extension of the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation method to account for error propagation offers a promising approach to improving the accuracy of lattice QCD calculations for complex, multiparticle systems, including those relevant to heavy-particle decay processes."}}

The DGL theory describes the QCD vacuum as a dual\nsuperconductor and possesses electric flux-tube solutions via the dual Meissner\neffect, which applies to the quark confinement mechanism. We demonstrate a\npowerful numerical method for solving the field equations in the DGL theory\nwith U(1) dual gauge symmetry. An essential aspect of our method is to\nformulate the DGL theory on the dual lattice, which enables us to investigate\nany system composed of finite-length flux tubes in a systematic manner. Taking\nfull advantage of the dual lattice formulation, we investigate the\nfinite-length flux-tube solution corresponding to the quark-antiquark system in\ndetail, which exposes the significant terminal effects absent in the infinitely\nlong flux-tube solution. We also study the flux-tube interaction in the two-\nand multi-flux-tube systems, providing new insights into the nonperturbative\nproperties of QCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a numerical method for solving field equations in the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory, which models QCD as a dual superconductor.
