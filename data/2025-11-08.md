Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper provides a detailed analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, focusing on their renormalization within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS), and includes a classification, Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order are also presented for variants with smaller mixing effects.

Motivation: The motivation is to study a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, particularly their renormalization, without mixing with lower-dimensional operators due to their flavor-symmetry group transformation properties. This includes all $\Delta F = 2$ operators and similar, as well as a subset of $\Delta F = 1$ and $\Delta F = 0$ operators, providing a thorough classification and understanding of these operators.

Method: The method involves analyzing the renormalization of the four-quark operators within a Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). The study explores different variants of GIRS, including a democratic version that treats all mixing operators uniformly. For selected variants, conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order are provided.

Result: The results include a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, an exploration of their Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns, and the presentation of conversion matrices from GIRS to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order for selected variants with smaller mixing effects.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a comprehensive understanding of the scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark operators, their renormalization in the GIRS, and the provision of necessary tools for converting between different renormalization schemes, which is valuable for future theoretical and experimental studies.

Abstract: In this paper we study a complete set of scalar and pseudoscalar four-quark
operators, with a particular emphasis on their renormalization within a
Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS). We focus on operators that do
not mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation
properties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\Delta F =
2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same
irreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial
subset of $\Delta F = 1$ and $\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis
provides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their
Fierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants
of GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing
operators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing
effects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order.
