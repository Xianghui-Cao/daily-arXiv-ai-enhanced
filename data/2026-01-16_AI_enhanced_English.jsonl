Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices, focusing on a minimal electric field truncation. It provides the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for specific lattice structures and discusses the extension to general SU(Nc) theories. The study includes exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian to find the energy spectrum, computation of the SU(3) string tension, and an analysis of static quark potential energies under various conditions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of SU(3) gauge theory in a simplified setting, by limiting the electric field representations, which allows for more manageable computations while still capturing essential physics. This approach can potentially be extended to more complex SU(Nc) theories and could provide insights into the dynamics of quarks and gluons in QCD.", "method": "The method involves constructing the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for truncated SU(3) gauge theory on different lattice geometries, such as the square plaquette chain and the honeycomb lattice. The authors use exact diagonalization to compute the energy spectrum and analyze its statistical properties. They also calculate the SU(3) string tension and investigate the potential energies between static quarks at finite temperatures.", "result": "Results include the energy spectrum of the gauge field, the SU(3) string tension with modifications due to vacuum fluctuations, and the potential energies of static quark-antiquark pairs and three-quark systems. The screening of these potentials at finite temperature is also analyzed, providing insight into the thermal behavior of the system.", "conclusion": "The conclusion would likely summarize the key findings from the numerical and analytical results, discussing the implications for our understanding of SU(3) gauge theory in the context of QCD. It may also highlight the potential for extending this work to more complex gauge groups and the relevance of the results for the study of quark confinement and deconfinement transitions."}}

We apply an extended HAL QCD potential method to a baryonic system made up from a static quark and a diquark. Numerical calculations are performed by employing 2+1 flavor QCD gaugeconfigurations generated by CP-PACS and JLQCD Collaborations on a $16^{3} \\times 32$ lattice with $a^{-1} \\approx 1.6$ GeV. To improve the statistical noise in the propagators of the static quark, the HYP smearing is employed on the gauge links. Two-point correlators of quark-diquark baryonic system are then computed to obtain their ground-state energies where various types of diquarks are considered (eg: scalar diquark, axial-vector diquark etc). We apply an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system made up from a scalar diquark and a static quark to study the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential. In order to determine the diquark mass self-consistently in this HALQCD method, we demand that the baryonic spectrum in the p-wave sector obtained from the two-point correlators should be reproduced by the potential obtained from the baryonic system in the s-wave sector. We obtain the scalar diquark mass of roughly $(2/3) m_{N}$ , i.e., twice the na\u00efve estimates of a constituent quark mass together with the quark-diquark potential of Cornell type (Coulomb + linear).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper calculates the diquark mass and quark-diquark potential using an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system, finding a scalar diquark mass of approximately two-thirds of the nucleon mass with a Cornell-type quark-diquark potential.", "motivation": "The motivation is to accurately determine the diquark mass and the form of the quark-diquark potential within a baryonic system, which is important for understanding the internal structure of baryons and the dynamics of quarks within them.", "method": "An extended HAL QCD potential method is applied to a baryonic system consisting of a static quark and a diquark. The calculations use 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations on a lattice. HYP smearing is used to improve statistical noise, and two-point correlators are computed to extract ground-state energies and potentials.", "result": "The scalar diquark mass is found to be about two-thirds of the nucleon mass, which is twice the estimate of a constituent quark mass. The quark-diquark potential follows a Cornell type, combining Coulomb and linear terms.", "conclusion": "The study successfully determines the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential using the extended HAL QCD method, providing insights into the baryonic structure and confirming the self-consistency of the method through the reproduction of the p-wave sector spectrum."}}
