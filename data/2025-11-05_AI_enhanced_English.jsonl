Combining\nneural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can reshape the energy landscape\nand accelerate sampling, but the choice of neural architectures has yet to be\nstudied systematically. We evaluate NTHMC on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge\ntheory, analyzing how it scales and transfers to larger volumes and smaller\nlattice spacing. Controlled comparisons let us isolate architectural\ncontributions to sampling efficiency. Good designs can reduce autocorrelation\nand boost topological tunneling while maintaining favorable scaling. More\nbroadly, our study highlights emerging design guides, such as wider receptive\nfields and channel-dependent activations, paving the way for systematic\nextensions to four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the use of neural field transformations with Hybrid Monte Carlo (NTHMC) to improve sampling efficiency in lattice gauge theory simulations, particularly focusing on the choice of neural architectures. It evaluates NTHMC's performance on a 2D U(1) gauge theory and identifies design principles that can reduce autocorrelation and enhance topological tunneling, with the potential for application in 4D SU(3) gauge theory.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the issue of critical slowing down in lattice gauge theory simulations, where the efficiency of sampling through configuration space decreases as one approaches the continuum limit. The paper aims to explore how the integration of neural field transformations with HMC (NTHMC) can be optimized by choosing appropriate neural network architectures to mitigate this problem.", "method": "The method involves evaluating the NTHMC approach on a two-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, using controlled comparisons to assess the impact of different neural architectures on sampling efficiency. The study analyzes scalability and transferability to larger volumes and finer lattice spacings, and it identifies beneficial design features such as wider receptive fields and channel-dependent activations.", "result": "The results show that well-designed neural architectures within the NTHMC framework can significantly reduce autocorrelation times and increase topological tunneling, which are key factors for efficient sampling. These improvements are observed while maintaining good scaling properties as the system size and lattice spacing change.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the study is that specific neural architecture designs, when used in conjunction with NTHMC, can greatly enhance the sampling efficiency of lattice gauge theory simulations. The findings provide a set of guidelines for future work, including the potential extension of these methods to more complex, four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theories."}}
