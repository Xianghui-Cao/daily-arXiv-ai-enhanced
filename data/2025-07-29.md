Abstract: We investigate the twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) reduced model of
four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory in the presence of two-flavor adjoint
fermions (adjoint TEK model). Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist
parameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\ll\kappa_c $) and
inverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions
stabilize the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal
twist satisfying $k/\sqrt{N} < 1/9$, where the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is
spontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also
suggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to
$SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the
adjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially
reduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ and study
the theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions.
Numerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and
$\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with
periodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined)
phase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining
transition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic
adjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency
checks supporting these findings.

### [2] [Lattice study of scattering phase shifts for $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems using twisted boundary conditions: search for bound state formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20712)
*Masato Nagatsuka,Shoichi Sasaki*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates S- and P-wave phase shifts for DD* and BB* scatterings using Lüscher's finite-size method with twisted boundary conditions to search for doubly charmed and bottomed tetraquarks. The study employs 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles and a relativistic heavy quark action, suggesting a shallow bound state in the BB* system at physical pion mass.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to search for doubly charmed tetraquarks (Tcc+) and doubly bottomed tetraquarks (Tbb-) as hadronic bound states by investigating the scattering phase shifts of DD* and BB* systems. The Tcc+ has been observed experimentally, while the Tbb- is theoretically predicted. The use of twisted boundary conditions allows for the calculation of phase shifts at any momentum and access to P-wave phase shifts.

Method: Lüscher's finite-size method under twisted boundary conditions is used to calculate the S- and P-wave phase shifts for DD* and BB* scatterings. The study uses 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at different pion masses and a relativistic heavy quark action to reduce lattice discretization artifacts due to heavy quark mass. The partially twisted boundary conditions enable continuous variation of the twisting angle and mixing of S- and P-waves.

Result: The results include the determination of S- and P-wave scattering phase shifts for the DD* and BB* systems in both I=0 and I=1 channels. A shallow bound state with a binding energy of O(100) keV in the BB* system at the physical pion mass is suggested, which has the quantum number I(J^P)=0(1^+).

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the research has successfully calculated the S- and P-wave phase shifts for DD* and BB* systems and found evidence for a shallow bound state in the BB* system, consistent with the theoretical prediction of the Tbb- tetraquark. The findings support the existence of such exotic hadrons and provide insights into their properties.

Abstract: We investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave phase shifts for the $DD^\ast$ and
$BB^\ast$ scatterings using L\"uscher's finite-size method under twisted
boundary conditions to search for doubly charmed tetraquaks, $T_{cc}^+$, and
doubly bottomed tetraquarks, $T_{bb}^-$ as the hadronic bound states. The
$T_{cc}^+$ state was observed as a peak just bellow the $DD^*$ threshold by
LHCb Collaboration, while the $T_{bb}^-$ state is a theoretically predicted
tetraquark state having heavier quark flavors $bb\bar u \bar d$. L\"uscher's
finite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the
scattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several
studies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to
determine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$
system. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the
$BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the
$DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types
of partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted
boundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any
momentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to
easily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$-
and $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1
flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used. For
charm and bottom quarks, the relativistic heavy quark action is adopted to
reduce the lattice discretization artifacts due to the heavy quark mass. We
discuss the emergence of a shallow bound state with a binding energy of
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV at the physical pion mass in the $BB^*$ system, which
has the quantum number $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$.

TL;DR: The paper presents a computation of the electromagnetic form factors for protons and neutrons using lattice QCD, with a focus on physical quark masses, multiple lattice spacings, and sink-source time separations. It also discusses techniques to reduce stochastic noise in the estimation of disconnected contributions and provides results for electric and magnetic mean square radii as well as magnetic moments.

Motivation: The motivation is to accurately compute the electromagnetic form factors for protons and neutrons, which are fundamental quantities that describe the internal structure of these nucleons, by employing advanced lattice QCD methods and reducing systematic errors through careful analysis and the use of multiple ensembles at the physical pion mass.

Method: The method involves using $N_\mathrm{f}$=2+1+1 twisted mass clover-improved fermions with physical quark masses, three different lattice spacings, and various sink-source time separations to analyze excited state effects. The study also includes high-statistics calculations and specific noise-reduction techniques for the disconnected contributions, such as low-mode deflation, dilution, and hierarchical probing. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is analyzed using the $z$-expansion and dipole Ans\"atze.

Result: The results include the determination of the proton and neutron electric and magnetic mean square radii, as well as their magnetic moments. The reported values are: $\sqrt{\langle r_E^2\rangle^p} = 0.860(38)(23)$ fm, $\langle r_E^2\rangle^n = -0.147(48)$ fm$^2$, $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^p} = 0.870(53)(15)$ fm, $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^n} = 0.913(67)(19)$ fm, $\mu^p=2.849(92)(52)$, and $\mu^n=-1.819(76)(29)$. The errors provided reflect both statistical and systematic uncertainties, including those from fitting the form factor's momentum dependence and the continuum extrapolation.

Conclusion: The conclusion would be that the research has successfully computed the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron with improved precision, taking into account various sources of systematic errors. The results provide an accurate description of the nucleon's internal structure and electromagnetic properties, which can be used for further theoretical and experimental studies.

Abstract: We compute the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron using
lattice QCD. We employ $N_\mathrm{f}$=2+1+1 twisted mass clover-improved
fermions with quark masses tuned to their physical values. Three ensembles with
lattice spacings of $a$=0.080 fm, 0.068 fm, and 0.057 fm, and approximately the
same physical volume allow us to obtain the continuum limit directly at the
physical pion mass. For each ensemble, we use several values of the sink-source
time separation, ranging from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm, to allow for a thorough
analysis of excited state effects via multi-state fits. The disconnected
contributions are also analyzed using high statistics combined with techniques
to mitigate stochastic noise in the estimation of the fermion loop. These
techniques include low-mode deflation, dilution in the color and spin
components, and hierarchical probing. We study the momentum transfer dependence
of the form factors using the $z$-expansion and dipole Ans\"atze, thereby
enabling the extraction of the electric and magnetic radii and the magnetic
moments, as well as the Zemach and Friar radii in the continuum limit. Results
for the proton and neutron electric and magnetic mean square radii are
$\sqrt{\langle r_E^2\rangle^p} = 0.860(38)(23)$ fm, $\langle r_E^2\rangle^n =
-0.147(48)$ fm$^2$, $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^p} = 0.870(53)(15)$ fm and
$\sqrt{\langle r_M^2\rangle^n} = 0.913(67)(19)$ fm, and for the proton and
neutron magnetic moments $\mu^p=2.849(92)(52)$ and $\mu^n=-1.819(76)(29)$,
respectively. In all cases, the first error is statistical and the second
systematic, where the latter includes an estimate of the error from the fits to
the momentum dependence of the form factors and from the continuum
extrapolation.
