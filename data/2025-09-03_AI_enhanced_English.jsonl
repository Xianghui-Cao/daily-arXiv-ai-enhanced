Invited review in the Perspective section of the\n  journal Research", "summary": "Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for\ncomputing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first\nprinciples using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field\ntheory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion\nand perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables --\nquasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in\nlattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon\nresummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates\nhigher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative\nand power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical\nuncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further\nsimplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative\nregion. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton\nobservables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently\nproposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access\nto unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios,\nwhich will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power\ncorrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state\ncontamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions,\nare expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state\nisolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have\nentered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement,\nwhich will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaMET is a theory for computing the proton's partonic structure using lattice QCD.
