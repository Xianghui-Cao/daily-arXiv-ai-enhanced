### [1] [Moment problems and bounds for matrix-valued smeared spectral functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01377)
*Ryan Abbott,William I. Jay,Patrick R. Oare*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper establishes the connection between numerical analytic continuation in lattice field theory and moment problems, using Kovalishina's mathematical results to provide rigorous bounds on spectral functions. It integrates this perspective with recent advancements in the Rayleigh-Ritz method and Lanczos algorithm, also discussing potential limitations due to finite numerical precision.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of numerical analytic continuation in lattice field theory, especially for spectroscopy, by leveraging well-studied mathematical techniques from moment problems and integrating them with contemporary computational methods.

Method: The paper employs Kovalishina's mathematical results to derive rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral functions, utilizing positive-definite matrices of Euclidean-time correlation functions as input. The work also connects these findings with the Rayleigh-Ritz method and the Lanczos algorithm.

Result: The result is a novel numerical implementation that provides rigorous bounds on spectral functions, which can be used in variational spectrum studies within lattice quantum chromodynamics. The paper also discusses the integration of this approach with modern computational techniques and addresses possible limitations due to finite numerical precision.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the application of moment-problem techniques, specifically Kovalishina's results, offers a new and mathematically rigorous way to handle numerical analytic continuation, complementing existing methods such as the Rayleigh-Ritz and Lanczos algorithms, while also acknowledging the challenges posed by finite numerical precision.

Abstract: Numerical analytic continuation arises frequently in lattice field theory,
particularly in spectroscopy problems. This work shows the equivalence of
common spectroscopic problems to certain classes of moment problems that have
been studied thoroughly in the mathematical literature. Mathematical results
due to Kovalishina enable rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral
functions, which are implemented numerically for the first time. The required
input is a positive-definite matrix of Euclidean-time correlation functions;
such matrices are routinely computed in variational spectrum studies using
lattice quantum chromodynamics. This work connects the moment-problem
perspective to recent developments using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and Lanczos
algorithm. Possible limitations due to finite numerical precision are
discussed.

Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays provide an excellent probe
for determining whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions. The
short-range matrix elements associated with the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ process
contribute at leading order in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay channel $nn \to ppee$
through pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations
show notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To
address this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^- \to
\pi^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical
pion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate
contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to
reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a
nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with
previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements
and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the
discrepancies among previous lattice calculations.

### [3] [Hollow Lattice Tensor Gauge Theories with Bosonic Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02326)
*José M. Cruz,Masafumi Udagawa,Pedro Bicudo,Pedro Ribeiro,Paul A. McClarty*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores a 4D lattice tensor gauge theory with second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields, coupled to bosonic matter. The phase diagram is mapped using Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the strong coupling confined phase dominates the entire phase diagram, with instantons preventing the weak coupling phase. For q=1, a single thermodynamic phase with a first-order transition ending at a critical point is found, while for q=2, a distinct Higgs phase consistent with the X-cube model's fractonic topological order is observed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of higher rank gauge theories, particularly in four dimensions, by studying the phase transitions and the nature of correlators in a lattice model with tensor gauge fields and bosonic matter. The goal is to map out the phase diagram and understand how the system behaves under different couplings of the gauge and matter fields.

Method: The authors derive the lattice action from the Hamiltonian for the gauge fields coupled to charged scalars (q=1,2). They use this action to perform Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagram as a function of the gauge (beta) and matter (kappa) couplings. They also compute and compare the nature of correlators at strong and weak coupling limits in the pure gauge theory with numerical simulation results.

Result: The results show that the strong coupling confined phase spans the whole phase diagram, with instantons destroying the expected weak coupling phase. For q=1, there is a single thermodynamic phase with a first-order phase transition ending at a critical endpoint. For q=2, a distinct Higgs phase is found, which is consistent with the X-cube model exhibiting Z2 fractonic topological order.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the strong coupling confined phase is dominant in the phase diagram, and that the naive weak coupling regime does not persist in the thermodynamic limit. The presence of a Higgs phase for q=2 is confirmed, and the role of instantons in the destruction of the weak coupling phase is highlighted, providing insights into the behavior of 4D tensor gauge theories.

Abstract: Higher rank gauge theories are generalizations of electromagnetism where, in
addition to overall charge conservation, there is also conservation of higher
rank multipoles such as the total dipole moment. In this work we study a four
dimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has
second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on
individual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action
for the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action
formulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a
function of the gauge ($\beta$) and matter ($\kappa$) couplings. We compute the
nature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and
compare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive
weak coupling regime (small $\kappa$, large $\beta$) does not survive in the
thermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the
whole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak
coupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected
strong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For
finite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit
with a first order phase transition terminating in a critical endpoint.For
$q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic
topological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed
reveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case.
