Loops that initially appear\ndisconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected\nsurface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first\ntime, these secondary loops are identified as \"connected\" or \"disconnected\"\nwith respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of\ncentre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low\ntemperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the\nsame sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small\nsecondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above\nthe phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a\nsingle large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With\nthe near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension,\nconnected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such\nas the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes\nthemselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry\nin four dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the 4D mapping of center-vortex surfaces in SU(3) lattice gauge theory, revealing that secondary loops, which appear disconnected in 3D, are often connected in 4D. This insight is used to analyze the geometry of vortices through a finite-temperature phase transition, showing a change in vortex structure alignment and secondary loop presence.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the role and origin of secondary loops in the center-vortex structure, which appear separate from the main percolating cluster in three-dimensional visualizations, by mapping them out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory.", "method": "The method involves identifying and analyzing 'connected' or 'disconnected' secondary loops with respect to the vortex sheet in four dimensions, as well as studying the evolution of the center-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition, including the analysis of novel quantities such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and their sizes.", "result": "At low temperatures, most secondary loops are found to be part of the same percolating sheet in four dimensions, while above the phase transition, the vortex structure aligns with the temporal dimension, and connected secondary loops become rare due to the absence of curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the four-dimensional analysis of center-vortex surfaces provides new insights into the connectivity and evolution of the vortex geometry, particularly through the finite-temperature phase transition, and highlights the importance of considering the full 4D structure for a complete understanding of these phenomena."}}
