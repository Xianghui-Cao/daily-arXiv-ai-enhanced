The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the\nscalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the\nglobal symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous\nbreaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the\nmodel. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling\nare examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial\nsymmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300\nto 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning\nbare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$\nbosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of\nthe $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are\nexplored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated\nlower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and\nindependent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak\ntransition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing\nproperties of a smooth crossover behavior."}
