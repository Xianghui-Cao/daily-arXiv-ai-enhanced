TL;DR: The paper analyzes 13 ensembles, NME, with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions, examining meson and baryon spectra, decay constants, flow scales, and the behavior of certain operators under gradient flow. It determines physical point values for flow scales and the ratio f_K / f_π, and performs a chiral perturbation theory analysis on baryon masses, preferring NNLO fits for octet baryons.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a detailed analysis of the 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermion ensembles (NME) by studying various physical quantities and their implications in the context of lattice QCD, including the determination of physical point values and the study of baryon mass fitting using chiral perturbation theory.

Method: The method involves generating 13 ensembles with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions, analyzing the meson and baryon spectrum, decay constants, flow scales, and operator behaviors under gradient flow, and applying heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBχPT) at NLO and NNLO to fit baryon masses.

Result: The results include the determination of physical point values for flow scales t0 and w0, the ratio f_K / f_π, and a preference for NNLO fits in the case of octet baryon masses, with no clear distinction for decuplet Omega mass. The study also finds no evidence of freezing of topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator even at large flow time.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the analysis provides valuable insights into the properties of 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermion ensembles, including the determination of key physical parameters and the suitability of NNLO HBχPT for describing octet baryon masses, while also indicating the absence of autocorrelation issues in the data.

Abstract: This paper describes the thirteen ensembles, named NME, generated with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions by the JLab/W\&M/LANL/MIT/Marseille collaborations, and presents an analysis of the meson and baryon spectrum, decay constants $f_π$ and $f_K$, flow scales $t_0$ and $w_0$, and time histories of the $Θ$ and Weinberg operators under gradient flow. Using these quantities, the physical point values of the two flow scales, ${t_0^{\rm Phy}}$ and ${w_0^{\rm Phy}}$, and the ratio $\mathop{f_K / f_π}^{\rm Phy}$ are determined. The masses of the octet and decuplet baryons are analyzed using both the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ansatz from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB$χ$PT). The NNLO fit to the octet baryons, $M_N$, $M_Σ$, $M_Λ$ and $M_Ξ$, is preferred while the corresponding fits to the decuplet Omega mass, $M_Ω$, are not distinguished. We also present a study of the autocorrelations in the data and show that there is no evidence, even at large flow time, of the freezing of the topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide accurate determinations of renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass in N=1 SYM theory, which are important for setting up and calibrating lattice simulations.

Method: The method involves the use of clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links in lattice perturbation theory to compute two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order. The study also analyzes the effect of lattice discretization on the axial current to ensure its conservation.

Result: The results include the computed renormalization factors and the identification of a smearing parameter value that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. These findings offer practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures in lattice simulations of SYM.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the methodology used, including the specific lattice setup and analysis of lattice artifacts, provides valuable information for the calibration and fine-tuning of lattice simulations in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the renormalization factors for the gluino and gluon fields, the gauge parameter, the coupling constant, as well as the scalar, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector gluino bilinear operators in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, using improved lattice actions. Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM.
