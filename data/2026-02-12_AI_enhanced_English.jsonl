We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\le T_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\le 158\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the localization of low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature using lattice simulations with staggered fermions, finding that localized modes appear at a temperature closely matching the pseudocritical crossover temperature.", "motivation": "To understand the behavior of low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD and their relation to the chiral phase transition, particularly the emergence of localized modes as the temperature increases towards the crossover region.", "method": "Lattice QCD simulations with staggered fermions were employed to analyze the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes across a range of temperatures near the crossover point. The specific observables used for identifying the pseudocritical temperature include the chiral condensate and light-quark susceptibility.", "result": "Localized low-lying Dirac eigenmodes are observed to emerge within a narrow temperature window between 155 MeV and 158 MeV, which is consistent with the pseudocritical temperature determined from other independent measurements such as the chiral condensate and light-quark susceptibility.", "conclusion": "The appearance of localized low-lying Dirac eigenmodes around the QCD crossover temperature suggests a close connection between the localization of these modes and the chiral phase transition, providing further insights into the nature of the QCD phase diagram."}}
