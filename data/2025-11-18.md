*Jing-Yu Yi,Ze-Rui Liang,Liuming Liu,De-Liang Yao*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A lattice QCD calculation of the S-wave interactions between spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons is performed, revealing an attractive interaction in the ΞccK(1,0) channel and repulsive interactions in other channels. A virtual state pole is found, providing input for high-precision studies of doubly heavy baryon properties.

Motivation: The motivation is to study the S-wave interactions between ground-state spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons using lattice QCD, which can provide insights into the spectroscopy and properties of these particles.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations are carried out on four 2+1 flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles with specific lattice spacing and pion masses. Energy levels for four single channels are extracted, and Lüscher's finite-volume formula is used to determine near-threshold phase shifts and S-wave scattering lengths.

Result: Results show that the ΞccK(1,0) channel is attractive, while the other three channels (ΩccK̄(-2,1/2), ΞccK(1,1), and Ξccπ(0,3/2)) are repulsive. A virtual state pole is identified in the ΞccK(1,0) scattering amplitude, indicating a bound or resonant state.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study provides ab initio input for the high-precision investigation of the properties and spectroscopy of doubly heavy baryons, with the identification of an attractive interaction in the ΞccK(1,0) channel and a virtual state pole.

Abstract: We perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $S$-wave interactions between the ground-state spin-$1/2$ doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons. The lattice QCD simulations are carried out on four $2+1$ flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles generated by the CLQCD collaboration, with a lattice spacing $a=0.07746$ fm and two different pion masses, $M_π\sim 210$ and $\sim 300~\mathrm{MeV}$. Energy levels are extracted for four single channels, $Ω_{cc}\bar{K}^{(-2,1/2)}$, $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,1)}$, $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$, and $Ξ_{cc}π^{(0,3/2)}$, where the superscripts $(S,I)$ denote strangeness $S$ and isospin $I$. Our results indicate that the $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ channel is attractive, exhibiting negative energy shifts relative to the non-interacting two-hadron thresholds, while the other three channels are repulsive. Using Lüscher's finite-volume formula, we extract the near-threshold phase shifts and determine the $S$-wave scattering lengths. Furthermore, a virtual state pole is found in the $Ξ_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ scattering amplitude. These results provide ab initio input to enable high-precision studies of the properties and spectroscopy of doubly heavy baryons.

### [2] [SO(3) real algebra method for finite baryon-number density QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13551)
*Hideo Suganuma,Kei Tohme*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel method, the SO(3) real algebra method, is introduced for lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities. It simplifies the SU(3) gauge variable by dividing it into SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts, and uses a maximal SO(3) gauge to minimize the latter. The Monte Carlo calculation employs a real, non-negative SO(3) fermionic determinant, which, combined with a positive SU(3) gauge action factor, allows for feasible computations if the phase factor of the ratio between SU(3) and SO(3) determinants does not fluctuate significantly.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges in performing lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities. The authors aim to find a way to make these calculations more feasible by reducing the complexity of the SU(3) gauge variables and addressing the sign problem associated with the fermionic determinant.

Method: The method proposed is called the 'SO(3) real algebra method,' which involves decomposing the SU(3) gauge variable into SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) components. A 'maximal SO(3) gauge' is then defined to minimize the SU(3)/SO(3) part. In the Monte Carlo process, the real and non-negative SO(3) fermionic determinant is used alongside the positive SU(3) gauge action factor. The method alternates between gauge fixing and updates on the SO(3) determinant and the gauge action factor.

Result: The result of implementing the SO(3) real algebra method is that lattice QCD calculations at finite densities become more tractable. This is provided that the phase factor of the ratio between the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants does not exhibit significant fluctuations across the sampled gauge configurations, which would otherwise complicate the calculations.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the abstract is that the SO(3) real algebra method, by employing a real and non-negative SO(3) fermionic determinant and a positive SU(3) gauge action factor, has the potential to enable lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities. The feasibility of such calculations hinges upon the stability of the phase factor of the determinant ratio during the Monte Carlo sampling.

Abstract: For lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities, we propose the ``SO(3) real algebra method'', in which the SU(3) gauge variable is divided into the SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts. In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly in the sampled gauge configurations, then lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.
