These theories\nplay an important role in proposals for completion of the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, hence the phase transition might have occurred in the early\nstages of evolution of our universe, leaving behind a detectable relic\nstochastic background of gravitational waves. Lattice field theory studies\nimplementing the density of states method have the potential to provide\ndetailed information about the phase transition, and measure the parameters\ndetermining the gravitational-wave power spectrum, by overcoming some the\nchallenges faced with importance-sampling methods. We assess this potential for\na representative choice of Yang-Mills theory with $Sp(4)$ gauge group. We\ncharacterize its finite-temperature, first-order phase transition, in the\nthermodynamic (infinite volume) limit, for two different choices of number of\nsites in the compact time direction, hence taking the first steps towards the\ncontinuum limit extrapolation. We demonstrate the persistence of\nnon-perturbative phenomena associated to the first-order phase transition:\ncoexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, surface tension. We find\nconsistency between several different strategies for the extraction of the\nvolume-dependent critical coupling, hence assessing the size of systematic\neffects. We also determine the minimum choice of ratio between spatial and time\nextent of the lattice that allows to identify the contribution of the surface\ntension to the free energy. We observe that this ratio scales non-trivially\nwith the time extent of the lattice, and comment on the implications for future\nhigh-precision numerical studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the first-order, confinement/deconfinement phase transition in non-Abelian gauge theories using the density of states method in lattice field theory. It examines a Yang-Mills theory with an $Sp(4)$ gauge group and provides detailed information about the phase transition, including the persistence of non-perturbative phenomena and the determination of the volume-dependent critical coupling.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the phase transitions in non-Abelian gauge theories, which are important for completing the Standard Model of particle physics, and to potentially detect a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves from the early universe.", "method": "The researchers use lattice field theory studies implementing the density of states method to analyze the phase transition of a Yang-Mills theory with an $Sp(4)$ gauge group. They characterize the finite-temperature, first-order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit and assess systematic effects by comparing different strategies for extracting the critical coupling.", "result": "The results show the persistence of non-perturbative phenomena associated with the first-order phase transition, such as coexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, and surface tension. The study also determines the minimum ratio between spatial and time extent of the lattice that allows for the identification of the contribution of the surface tension to the free energy.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the density of states method can provide detailed information about the phase transition and measure the parameters determining the gravitational-wave power spectrum. It also highlights the importance of considering the scaling of the lattice's spatial and time extent for future high-precision numerical studies."}}
