### [1] [Asymptotic Long-Distance Expansion of Euclidean Correlators in Lattice Parton Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12189)
*Xiangdong Ji,Yizhuang Liu,Yushan Su*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the asymptotic behaviors of bilinear Euclidean quark and gluon correlators, which are essential for computing non-perturbative collinear and soft parton physics. The authors use various theoretical methods to determine these behaviors and connect them to heavy-flavor hadron binding energies, with a demonstration on lattice QCD data.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the asymptotic behaviors of quark and gluon correlators that are widely used in large-momentum effective field theories, as they are crucial for the accurate computation of momentum-space Fourier transformations from lattice QCD data, especially at large spatial distances where color confinement causes an exponential decay.

Method: The method involves using heavy-quark effective theory, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and knowledge of heavy-flavor spectra to derive the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors of the correlators. Theoretical calculations are performed in φ^3 theory, and the results are also tested against actual lattice QCD data to ensure practical applicability and reliable error estimates.

Result: The result is the determination of the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors of the bilinear Euclidean quark and gluon correlators, with a connection established between the expansion parameters and the binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. The impact of this analysis on real-world lattice QCD data is assessed, and it is shown to provide reliable error estimates.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that by understanding the asymptotic behavior of the correlators, one can more accurately compute non-perturbative quantities in QCD, and the derived asymptotics can be used to improve the precision of lattice QCD computations, particularly for processes involving heavy flavors.

Abstract: Bilinear Euclidean quark and gluon correlators with Wilson links have been used widely for applications of large-momentum effective field theories to computing non-perturbative collinear and soft parton physics. Due to color confinement, these correlators decay exponentially at large spatial distances, a behavior crucial for computing momentum-space Fourier transformations with controlled errors from lattice QCD data. Using heavy-quark effective theory reduction, dispersive analysis, Lorentz symmetry, and heavy-flavor spectra, we determine the leading and next-to-leading asymptotic behaviors and relate the expansion parameters to binding energies of heavy-flavor hadrons. We demonstrate the results through two-loop calculations in $φ^3$ theory and from the perspective of locality and analyticity. We also study the impact of the asymptotic analysis on realistic lattice QCD data and demonstrate reliable error estimates.

### [2] [One-loop $c_\mathrm{SW}$ for Wilson and Brillouin fermions with stout smearing or Wilson flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12568)
*Maximilian Ammer,Stephan Durr*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the one-loop value of the improvement coefficient $c_\mathrm{SW}$ for Wilson and Brillouin fermions with stout smearing or Wilson flow, indicating that a small amount of smoothing improves the perturbative series, suggesting a non-perturbatively determined $c_\mathrm{SW}$ might be close to its one-loop value for couplings $g_0^2 \simeq 1$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine how stout smearing or Wilson flow affects the one-loop value of the improvement coefficient $c_\mathrm{SW}$ for certain types of fermions, and to explore whether a small amount of smoothing can make the perturbative series well behaved, potentially bringing the non-perturbatively determined $c_\mathrm{SW}$ closer to its one-loop value at specific coupling strengths.

Method: The authors use a recently developed method to modify an existing perturbative calculation for $c_\mathrm{SW}^{(1)}$ to include stout smearing or Wilson flow, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary stout parameters ($\varrho$, $n_\mathrm{stout}$) or flow times $t/a^2$.

Result: The results show that even a small amount of smoothing (via stout smearing or Wilson flow) makes the perturbative series well behaved, which suggests that the non-perturbatively determined $c_\mathrm{SW}$ could be close to its one-loop value for couplings around $g_0^2 \simeq 1$.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that stout smearing or Wilson flow has a positive impact on the perturbative behavior of the improvement coefficient $c_\mathrm{SW}$, and it may be possible to approximate the non-perturbative value with the one-loop value for moderate coupling strengths.

Abstract: We present results for the one-loop value of the improvement coefficient $c_\mathrm{SW}$ for Wilson and Brillouin fermions subject to stout smearing or Wilson flow, in combination with Wilson or Symanzik glue. To this end we use a recently developed method that allows one to modify an existing perturbative calculation, like the one for $c_\mathrm{SW}^{(1)}$, to include stout smearing or Wilson flow at arbitrary stout parameters ($\varrho$, $n_\mathrm{stout}$) or flow times $t/a^2$, respectively. Our results indicate that already a small amount of smoothing makes the perturbative series well behaved, suggesting that a non-perturbatively determined $c_\mathrm{SW}$ might be close to its one-loop value for couplings $g_0^2\simeq 1$.

### [3] [Lattice-QCD validation of hadron mass and trace-anomaly decomposition sum rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13070)
*Dennis Bollweg,Heng-Tong Ding,Xiang Gao,Ran Luo,Swagato Mukherjee*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper validates multiple sum rules related to the quark-gluon decomposition of hadron mass using lattice QCD, revealing significant gluonic contributions to charmonia masses and trace anomaly in specific sum rules. The method is applicable to other hadrons and nuclei for mass, spin decompositions, and gravitational form factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a first-principles validation of sum rules concerning the quark-gluon decomposition of hadron mass, which has not been achieved before with lattice QCD, and to establish a framework that can be used for further investigations into the internal structure of hadrons and nuclei.

Method: The method involves nonperturbative renormalization of the QCD energy-momentum tensor using a gradient-flow scheme, followed by continuum extrapolations, two-loop matching to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, and zero-flow-time extrapolations. This approach allows for a direct and simultaneous verification of the sum rules in a consistent renormalization scheme and scale. The study focuses on the $η_c$ and $J/ψ$ charmonia using fine lattice spacings with realistic quark masses.

Result: The results show that there are considerable gluonic contributions to the masses of charmonia, with about 15% in certain decompositions. Additionally, the contribution of the trace anomaly in the Ji sum rule is approximately 6%, and the gluonic component of the trace anomaly in another sum rule is around 35%. The research also provides the first lattice-QCD results for the gravitational form factor $\bar{C}$.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the developed lattice-QCD framework successfully verifies multiple sum rules for the quark-gluon decomposition of hadron mass and provides new insights into the role of gluons. The method is general and can be applied to other hadrons and nuclei, making it a valuable tool for future studies in particle physics.

Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD validation of multiple sum rules associated with quark-gluon decomposition of hadron mass by computing all components from first principles. We achieve this through nonperturbative renormalization of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, including its trace, in a gradient-flow scheme, followed by continuum extrapolations, two-loop matching to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, and zero-flow-time extrapolations. These ingredients enable a direct and simultaneous verification, in a common renormalization scheme and scale, of multiple energy-density-based and trace-based mass decomposition sum rules proposed in the literature. We demonstrate the framework for the $η_c$ and $J/ψ$ charmonia using three fine lattice spacings with a physical strange-quark and near-physical up- and down-quark masses. We present the first lattice-QCD results for the gravitational form factor $\bar{C}$. We find sizable gluonic contributions to charmonia masses at the hadronic scale, $\sim 15\%$ in the Lorcé and Metz-Pasquini-Rodini decompositions. The trace-anomaly contribution in the Ji sum rule is $\sim 6\%$, while the gluonic component of the trace anomaly in the Hatta-Rajan-Tanaka sum rule is $\sim 35\%$. The method is general and can be straightforwardly adopted for lattice-QCD calculations of mass and spin decompositions as well as gravitational form factors of other hadrons and nuclei.

### [4] [Onset of thermalization of q-deformed SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a trapped-ion quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13530)
*Tomoya Hayata,Yoshimasa Hidaka,Yuta Kikuchi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers used a trapped-ion quantum computer to simulate the thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(2)_3 Yang-Mills theory, focusing on nonabelian gauge theories. They simplified the model using Fibonacci anyons and successfully executed up to 47 sequential F-moves in their quantum circuits, with idling errors being mitigated by dynamical decoupling and parallelized F-moves.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance the field of quantum simulations, particularly in simulating nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, which are more relevant to real-world high-energy physics problems. The study aims to fill a gap where most experimental demonstrations have been limited to (1+1)-dimensional or abelian gauge theories.

Method: The method involves using a trapped-ion quantum computer to simulate the dynamics of a (2+1)-dimensional q-deformed SU(2)_3 Yang-Mills theory. The researchers simplify the model by restricting it to the integer-spin sector, resulting in a system described by Fibonacci anyons, and they use quantum circuits to perform F-moves, which are key operations for this type of simulation.

Result: The result is the successful simulation of the real-time dynamics of the simplified nonabelian gauge theory. The quantum circuits were capable of executing up to 47 sequential F-moves, and the team identified idling errors as the main source of error, which could be reduced with the use of dynamical decoupling and a parallelized approach to F-moves.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the quantum simulation of (2+1)-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories is feasible, and with the right techniques, such as dynamical decoupling, the effects of idling errors can be minimized. This work represents a step forward in the application of quantum computing to high-energy physics, particularly in exploring complex nonabelian gauge theories.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the main targets of quantum simulations. This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves.
