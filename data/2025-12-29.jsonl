Seven gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from $0.052~\\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\\text{fm}$, and different pion masses, from about $210~\\text{MeV}$ to $320~\\text{MeV}$ are utilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass extrapolation. The form factor ratios are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$ and $r_2=0.741(31)$. Our results of form factors reach the precision of $1\\%-4\\%$, which greatly improves the previous lattice QCD results and obtains the most precise determination to date."}

Takahashi", "Yoshiko Kanada-En'yo"], "title": "Lattice QCD study of color correlations between quarks in static multiquark systems", "comment": "15 pages, 23 figures", "summary": "We study the color correlation between two static quarks in 3Q ($QQQ$) and 4Q ($QQ\\bar Q\\bar Q$) multiquark systems at $T=0$ based on the reduced two-body density matrices $ρ$ in color space. We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $β= 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the two-body color density matrix $ρ$ of static quarks, and investigate the dependence of color correlations on the quarks' spatial configuration. As a result, we find that the color correlations depend on the minimal path length along a flux tube which connects two quarks under consideration. The color correlation between quarks quenches because of color leak into the gluon field (flux tube) and finally approaches the random color configuration in the large distance limit. We find a ``universality'' in the flux-tube path length dependence of the color leak for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q ground-state systems."}

The total action is local on $Λ$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.\n  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,Φ)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $Λ$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations; in particular, in $d=4$ we recover the standard one-loop $β$-function in a scalar $φ^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report $d=2$ proof-of-concept simulations showing a well-behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters."}
