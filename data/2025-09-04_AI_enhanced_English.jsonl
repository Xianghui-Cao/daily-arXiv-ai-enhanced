Effective\nPolyakov loop theories derived from lattice QCD via combined strong-coupling\nand hopping expansions are valid for heavy quarks only, but tractable with a\nsignificantly less severe sign problem. In this work, we apply three mean-field\napproximations to these effective theories, each incorporating local\nfluctuations to different degrees. We compare their predictions against Monte\nCarlo results for the deconfinement transition at high temperatures and for the\nbaryon onset transition at low temperatures. In agreement with earlier\neffective theory simulations, we find a first-order nuclear liquid-gas\ntransition with a critical end point for very low temperatures and moderately\nheavy quarks. While the location of fluctuation-dominated critical end points\nis expectedly inaccurate, the phase diagram of lattice QCD with heavy quarks\ncan be determined qualitatively with entirely analytical methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the application of three mean-field approximations to effective Polyakov loop theories, derived from lattice QCD, to study the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential.

It is known that $\\langle\n\\bar{\\psi} \\psi \\rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ of Dirac modes.

Its glue thus doesn't\ncontribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale\ninvariant consistently with the original claim.
