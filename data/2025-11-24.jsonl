Meyer"], "title": "Euclidean coordinate-space perturbation theory with a single mass scale", "comment": "47 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We develop elements of coordinate-space perturbation theory for massive quantum field theories in general $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, we provide analytic expressions for several three-point correlation functions in theories with one massive and one massless field. To this end, a class of antiderivatives of products of two Bessel functions multiplied by a power of their common argument are studied systematically. We expect these results to be useful in perturbative calculations involving vertices of high degree, at finite temperature and/or in finite volume, as well as in auxiliary perturbative computations for a lattice QCD treatment of hadronic effects in precision observables. As an illustration, we compute the one-loop coordinate-space propagator of a massive particle coupled to a massless one, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature."}

Murairi", "Erik J. Gustafson", "Henry Lamm"], "title": "Primitive Quantum Gates for an $SU(3)$ Discrete Subgroup: $Σ(72\\times3)$", "comment": "13 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of a discrete subgroup of $SU(3)$: the 216-element $Σ(72\\times3)$. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions. The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity would require about $10^{12}$ T gates which compares favorably to other modern estimates."}
