Abstract: We present the latest results from our ongoing lattice field theory
investigations of maximally supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in three
space-time dimensions, focusing on its non-perturbative phase diagram.
Exploiting a lattice formulation that preserves a subset of the supersymmetry
algebra at non-zero lattice spacing, we study the 'spatial deconfinement' phase
transition that holography relates to the transition between localized and
homogeneous black branes in the dual quantum gravity. Fixing $N_L^2 \times 8$
lattice volumes and N=8 colors in the SU(N) gauge group, we consider four
aspect ratios $\alpha = N_L / N_T \leq 4$ corresponding to $N_L = 16$, $20$,
$24$ and $32$. The transition temperatures we determine are in good agreement
with the low-temperature, large-N holographic expectation $T_c \propto
\alpha^3$.

### [2] [Chiral anomalies and Wilson fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18693)
*Michael Creutz*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the Wilson formulation of fermions in lattice gauge theory, which explains chiral anomalies through the behavior of eigenvalues of the discrete Dirac operator.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified description of chiral anomalies within the standard model using the Wilson formulation, and to explore the non-perturbative aspects that connect different topological sectors via the collision of eigenvalue pairs.

Method: The method involves analyzing the discrete Dirac operator, which is broken down into two by two blocks, and studying the possible eigenvalues that can form complex pairs or separate into real values with specific chirality.

Result: The analysis reveals that the collision of eigenvalue pairs happens outside the perturbative region and this phenomenon provides a transition path between distinct topological sectors.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the Wilson formulation offers insight into chiral anomalies and the non-perturbative transitions between topological sectors, which are essential for understanding the full dynamics of the standard model.

Abstract: The Wilson formulation of fermions in lattice gauge theory provides a unified
description of the chiral anomalies in the standard model. The discrete Dirac
operator diagonalizes into a series of two by two blocks. In each block the
possible eigenvalues either form a complex pair or separate into two real
eigenvalues that have specific chirality. The collision of these pairs of
eigenvalues occurs outside the perturbative region and provides a path between
topological sectors.
