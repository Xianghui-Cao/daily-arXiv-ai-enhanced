The\nmethods explored include Tikhonov regularization, the Backus-Gilbert method,\nthe Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and the\nfeedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). We evaluate the performance of\nthese methods using both mock data generated from toy models and real lattice\ndata from quasi distribution, and further compare them with the physics-driven\n$\\lambda$-extrapolation approach. Our results demonstrate that the L-IDFT\nconstitutes a moderately tractable inverse problem Except for the\nBackus-Gilbert method, all the other approaches are capable of correctly\nreconstructing the quasi-distributions in momentum space. In particular, the\nBayesian approach with GRW and the feedforward ANNs yield more stable and\naccurate reconstructions. Based on these investigations, we conclude that, for\na given L-IDFT problem, selecting an appropriate reconstruction method\naccording to the input data and carefully assessing the potential systematic\nuncertainties are essential for obtaining reliable results."}
