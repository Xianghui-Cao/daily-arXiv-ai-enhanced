Using exact diagonalization techniques, we show that the ground state in a class of models without the magnetic field always lies in the sector which satisfies $(G_e,G_o) = (d,\\ -d)$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $e$ and $o$ are even and odd sites. It can be analytically proven that this sector is free of the fermion sign problem. We also demonstrate that a meron cluster algorithm for the problem naturally samples the ground states of the Hamiltonian in the aforementioned Gauss Law sector."}

It is usually parameterized in terms of structure functions, which encode all necessary information for all kinematic regions. Moreover, the structure functions can be factorized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and contains information on hadron resonances. On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem. In our current work, we extend previous calculations on the nucleon by considering a much larger range of momentum transfers, which is inevitable in the context of structure functions. This can be achieved by using stochastic sources, which allows us to calculate the required four-point functions in a broad kinematic region. We employ a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass $m_π= 223~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and lattice spacing $a=0.085~\\mathrm{fm}$. In these proceedings, we will give an overview of our simulation and present some first preliminary results."}

These models naturally realize both confined and deconfined phases. Using classical Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the associated finite-temperature phase transitions and show that they exhibit the expected universality classes of conventional SU(N) lattice gauge theories in various spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist. Such critical points would provide a nonperturbative route to defining continuum limits of qubit-regularized gauge theories, potentially allowing Yang--Mills theory and related continuum gauge theories to emerge from finite-dimensional lattice constructions."}

In contrast to the index of the overlap Dirac operator defined through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, which is restricted to flat tori in even dimensions, our formulation offers several key advantages: 1) It can be applied straightforwardly to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for manifolds with boundary. 2) The boundary can be curved, allowing for the inclusion of gravitational background effects. 3) The mod-2 index in both even and odd dimensions can be defined as a natural extension of the same formulation. In this talk, we present the mathematical proof and provide numerical evidence supporting the formulation."}

In a recent paper, we proposed a novel method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to address the problem, and applied it to a toy model. In the present work we use this method for the electromagnetic form factors of the $ρ$-meson. By matching the results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, we provide a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $ρ$-meson within the effective field theory. Contact contributions to these form factors turn out to be substantial. A procedure for lattice calculations is outlined, paving the way for an ab initio approach to the problem."}

A central challenge is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, which is complicated by the nonlinear realization of the $O(3)$ symmetry leading to non-trivial operator mixing patterns, and by large discretization artifacts affecting the determination of renormalization constants. We present results for the renormalization constants in the non-singlet sector, employing a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and defining the renormalized coupling through the gradient flow. While we obtain a precise determination of the relative mixing constant $z_T$, the overall normalization $Z_T$ remains inaccessible due to large discretization artifacts. We discuss the origins of these difficulties and outline possible paths forward."}

This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks."}
