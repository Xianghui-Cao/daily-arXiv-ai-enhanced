In particular, we aim to identify a critical region\nexpected to exist along a $\\theta=\\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure\nnon-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor\nrenormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous\ntensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial\ntensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves\nhigher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement\nconsists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the\nconformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions,\nwhich can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group\nmethod. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the\ncritical region, $\\beta_{\\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the\nSU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model."}

A new estimate for the mass-dependent\nimprovement coefficient $\\bar{b}_{\\mathrm{A}}^\\mathrm{eff}$ has recently become\navailable, differing from the one used in our earlier study, and on which our\nimplementation via a massive axial Ward identity relied. Here, we update our\nanalysis of the mass-independent vector improvement coefficients based on the\nnew axial current improvement coefficient, and analyse additional ensembles\nwith a different chiral trajectory in order to validate our results at two\nvalues of the bare coupling. We find that using the new estimate of\n$\\bar{b}_{\\mathrm{A}}^\\mathrm{eff}$ improves the consistency between the two\nchiral trajectories, as well as with a previous determination of the\nimprovement coefficients directly in the massless limit on small volumes."}
