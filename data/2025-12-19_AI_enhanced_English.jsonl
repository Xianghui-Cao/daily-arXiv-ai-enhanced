Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper uses dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) to analyze lattice data from gauge theories, distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories. It finds that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions likely confines, while the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion exhibits infrared conformal behavior.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a diagnostic tool using dEFT to distinguish between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories in gauge theories close to the lower edge of the conformal window, which can help in understanding the phase structure of these theories.", "method": "The authors use dEFT to fit and analyze two sets of existing lattice data. One set is for an $SU(3)$ gauge theory with 8 Dirac fermions, and the other is for an $SU(2)$ gauge theory with 1 adjoint fermion. The analysis includes fitting the lattice data to determine whether the theories exhibit confinement or infrared conformality.", "result": "The analysis indicates that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions is more likely to be confining, whereas the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion shows signs of infrared conformal behavior. The results suggest that dEFT can serve as a useful tool for diagnosing the nature of the theories.", "conclusion": "The conclusion drawn from the study is that dEFT is a viable diagnostic tool for distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal theories. The authors also propose further lattice measurements and refinements to the dEFT analysis to test and strengthen the framework."}}
