Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature."}

We apply an extended HAL QCD potential method to a baryonic system made up from a static quark and a diquark. Numerical calculations are performed by employing 2+1 flavor QCD gaugeconfigurations generated by CP-PACS and JLQCD Collaborations on a $16^{3} \\times 32$ lattice with $a^{-1} \\approx 1.6$ GeV. To improve the statistical noise in the propagators of the static quark, the HYP smearing is employed on the gauge links. Two-point correlators of quark-diquark baryonic system are then computed to obtain their ground-state energies where various types of diquarks are considered (eg: scalar diquark, axial-vector diquark etc). We apply an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system made up from a scalar diquark and a static quark to study the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential. In order to determine the diquark mass self-consistently in this HALQCD method, we demand that the baryonic spectrum in the p-wave sector obtained from the two-point correlators should be reproduced by the potential obtained from the baryonic system in the s-wave sector. We obtain the scalar diquark mass of roughly $(2/3) m_{N}$ , i.e., twice the naïve estimates of a constituent quark mass together with the quark-diquark potential of Cornell type (Coulomb + linear)."}
