The analysis uses gluon configurations from the MILC\ncollaboration with vacuum polarization contributions from $u$, $d$, $s$, and\n$c$ quarks ($n_f=4$), and lattice spacings down to 0.032 fm. We find that\n$\\overline{m}_b(\\overline{m}_b,n_f=5) = 4.1911(62)$ GeV, $\\overline{m}_c(3\n\\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 0.9808(33)$ GeV, and $\\overline{m}_s(3\n\\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 83.34(26)$ MeV. These results are corrected for QED by\nincluding (quenched) QED in the simulations. They are among the most accurate\nvalues by any method to date. We give a detailed analysis of finite\nlattice-spacing errors that shows why the HISQ discretization of the quark\naction is particularly useful for $b$-quark simulations even for lattices where\n$am_b\\approx1$. We also calculate QED and isospin corrections to the\n(fictitious) $\\eta_s$-meson mass, which is used to tune $s$-quark masses in\nlattice simulations."}

In three-color QCD at finite density,\nespecially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte\nCarlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due\nto the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice\nstudies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles\ncalculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable\nfinding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography)\nbound, \\( c_s^2/c^2 \\le 1/3 \\), which had not been observed in QCD-like\ntheories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results\nfrom a series of works by our group~\\cite{Iida:2019rah,\nIida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related\nstudies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential.\nWe discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound\nviolation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective\nmodel analyses and recent observations of neutron stars."}

We focus on those terms which contain complex\ncontributions to the amplitude, due to on-shell intermediate states propagating\nbetween the weak operator and electromagnetic current(s). Such terms, which are\ngenerally estimated using model calculations and represent significant\nuncertainties in the phenomenological predictions for these decays, cannot be\ncomputed using standard lattice QCD techniques. It has recently been shown that\nsuch contributions can be computed using spectral-density methods and our\nproposed strategy, which we discuss in detail, is built on this approach. The\ncomplex contributions include the ``charming penguins\" (matrix elements of the\ncurrent-current operators $O_1^{(c)}$ and $O_2^{(c)}$ defined in Eq. (6)\nbelow), in which the charm-quark loop can propagate long distances,\nparticularly close to the region of charmonium resonances. They also include\nthe contributions from the chromomagnetic operator ($O_8$ in standard notation,\ndefined in Eq. (8) below). We discuss the renormalization of the ultra-violet\ndivergences, and in particular those which arise due to ``contact\" terms, and\nexplain how those which appear as inverse powers of the lattice spacing can be\nsubtracted non-perturbatively. We apply the spectral density methods in an\ninstructive exploratory computation of the charming penguin diagram in $B\\to\nK\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays in which the virtual photon is emitted from the\ncharm-quark loop (the diagram in Fig. 1(a) below) and discuss the prospects and\nstrategies for the reliable determination of the amplitudes in future dedicated\ncomputations."}
