The analysis uses gluon configurations from the MILC\ncollaboration with vacuum polarization contributions from $u$, $d$, $s$, and\n$c$ quarks ($n_f=4$), and lattice spacings down to 0.032 fm. We find that\n$\\overline{m}_b(\\overline{m}_b,n_f=5) = 4.1911(62)$ GeV, $\\overline{m}_c(3\n\\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 0.9808(33)$ GeV, and $\\overline{m}_s(3\n\\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 83.34(26)$ MeV. These results are corrected for QED by\nincluding (quenched) QED in the simulations. They are among the most accurate\nvalues by any method to date. We give a detailed analysis of finite\nlattice-spacing errors that shows why the HISQ discretization of the quark\naction is particularly useful for $b$-quark simulations even for lattices where\n$am_b\\approx1$.

This work aims to provide more precise values that can be used in other theoretical and experimental studies within particle physics.", "method": "The method involves using gluon configurations from the MILC collaboration, incorporating vacuum polarization effects from $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks, and employing lattice spacings as fine as 0.032 fm. The analysis utilizes the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) action, which is particularly advantageous for simulating $b$-quarks even at coarse lattice spacings.

The study also confirms the effectiveness of the HISQ discretization for $b$-quark simulations, even on lattices where $am_b \\approx 1$. Furthermore, the calculated corrections to the $\\eta_s$-meson mass contribute to the precision tuning of $s$-quark masses in future lattice simulations."}}

Recent independent lattice\nstudies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles\ncalculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics.

We focus on those terms which contain complex\ncontributions to the amplitude, due to on-shell intermediate states propagating\nbetween the weak operator and electromagnetic current(s). Such terms, which are\ngenerally estimated using model calculations and represent significant\nuncertainties in the phenomenological predictions for these decays, cannot be\ncomputed using standard lattice QCD techniques. It has recently been shown that\nsuch contributions can be computed using spectral-density methods and our\nproposed strategy, which we discuss in detail, is built on this approach. The\ncomplex contributions include the ``charming penguins\" (matrix elements of the\ncurrent-current operators $O_1^{(c)}$ and $O_2^{(c)}$ defined in Eq. (6)\nbelow), in which the charm-quark loop can propagate long distances,\nparticularly close to the region of charmonium resonances. They also include\nthe contributions from the chromomagnetic operator ($O_8$ in standard notation,\ndefined in Eq. (8) below). We discuss the renormalization of the ultra-violet\ndivergences, and in particular those which arise due to ``contact\" terms, and\nexplain how those which appear as inverse powers of the lattice spacing can be\nsubtracted non-perturbatively.
