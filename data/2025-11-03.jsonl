Our method enables the\nlearning of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues at arbitrary gauge couplings,\nsmoothly moving from the analytically known strong-coupling regime towards\nweaker couplings. By encoding the Schr\\\"odinger equation and the symmetries of\nthe eigenstates directly into the loss function, the network performs an\nunsupervised exploration of the spectrum. We validate the approach on the\nsingle-plaquette $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ pure-gauge theories,\nshowing that the PINNs successfully reproduce the hierarchy of energy levels\nand their corresponding wavefunctions."}

Sachrajda", "Xin-Yu Tuo"], "title": "Lattice Calculation of Light Meson Radiative Leptonic Decays", "comment": "54 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables", "summary": "In this work, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the branching ratios\nand the form factors of radiative leptonic decays $P \\to \\ell \\nu_\\ell \\gamma$\n($P = \\pi, K$) using $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion ensembles generated by the\nRBC and UKQCD collaborations at the physical pion mass. We adopt the infinite\nvolume reconstruction (IVR) method, which extends lattice data to infinite\nvolume and effectively controls the finite volume effects. This study\nrepresents a first step toward a complete calculation of radiative corrections\nto leptonic decays using the IVR method, including both real photon emissions\nand virtual photon loops. For decays involving a final state electron,\ncollinear radiative corrections, enhanced by the large logarithmic factors such\nas $\\ln(m_\\pi^2/m_e^2)$ and $\\ln(m_K^2/m_e^2)$, can reach the level of\n$O(10\\%)$ and are essential at the current level of theoretical and\nexperimental precision. After including these corrections, our result for $\\pi\n\\to e\\nu_e\\gamma$ agrees with the PIBETA measurement; for \\(K \\to\ne\\nu_e\\gamma\\), our results are consistent with the KLOE data and exhibit a\n$1.7\\sigma$ tension with E36; and for $K \\to \\mu\\nu_\\mu\\gamma$, where radiative\ncorrections are negligible, our results confirm the previously observed\ndiscrepancies between lattice results and the ISTRA/OKA measurements at large\nphoton energies, and with the E787 results at large muon photon angles."}

The Fr\\\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi (FMS)\nmechanism resolves this subtlety and predicts additional Higgs contributions in\nSM processes. While this has been supported by theoretical investigations in\nthe bosonic sector, its impact on fermionic observables remains largely\nunexplored. We use non-perturbative lattice techniques within a gauge-invariant\nframework to study a proxy theory of the weak sector with dynamical fermions.\nWe determine the physical spectrum of the theory and interpret the results in\nthe context of the FMS mechanism. Additionally, we identify suitable simulation\npoints for a scattering analysis as a first step toward cross-sections relevant\nto (future lepton) colliders."}

In\nparticular for U(1) LGTs, several such truncation schemes are known, which we\ncompare with each other using tensor network states. We show that a functional\nbasis obtained from single plaquette Hamiltonians -- which we call plaquette\nstate basis -- outperforms the other schemes in two spatial dimensions for\nplaquette, ground state energy and mass gap, as it is delivering accurate\nresults for a wide range of coupling strengths with a minimal number of basis\nstates. We also show that this functional basis can be efficiently used in\nthree spatial dimensions. Green's function Monte Carlo appears to be a highly\nuseful tool to verify tensor network states results, which deserves further\ninvestigation in the future."}

In\nHamiltonian quantisation, bosonic fields introduce the additional challenge of\nan infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We present a scalable quantum algorithm\nfor Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an Abelian gauge field theory in higher than\none spatial dimensions, designed to address this limit while preserving gauge\ninvariance. In our formulation, Gauss's law is automatically satisfied when the\nimplementation remains fully gauge invariant. We demonstrate how gauge\ninvariance is maintained throughout the lattice discretisation, digitisation,\nand qubitisation procedures, and identify the most efficient representation for\nextending to large Hilbert space dimensions. Within this framework, we\nbenchmark several quantum error mitigation techniques and find the calibration\nmethod to perform most effectively. The approach scales naturally to larger\nlattices, and we implement and test the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional setups on\ncurrent quantum hardware. Our results indicate that next-generation quantum\nplatforms could enable reliable, fully quantum simulations of large-scale QED\ndynamics."}
