The procedure\nrestores positivity in the (pseudo)-Goldstone masses and sets the constraint\n$\\Delta_{\\cal O} = d-2\\,$ for a single operator ${\\cal O}$ responsible for\ngenerating a dilaton mass.We discuss gravitational form factors as a tool to\nprobe infrared conformality in field theories with particle content. In a\nsecond part we explore to what extent QCD-like gauge theories (in the chiral\nlimit) could fit into this category. We find that the quark bilinear has\nscaling dimension $\\Delta_{\\bar qq} = d-2$, therefore satisfying the\ndouble-soft theorem. We show that some findings are realised in ${\\cal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric gauge theories and argue that the extension below the conformal\nwindow makes sense in that case."}
