In this\npaper, we present a new methodology based on regulated Laplace filters and\ndemonstrate that it can be used to address both issues using state-of-the-art\nsimulation data. Regulated Laplace filters are invertible high-pass filters\nthat suppress local correlations in the data, and we show that they can reduce\nthe condition number of covariance matrices by several orders of magnitude.\nFurthermore, Laplace filters can annihilate functions that decay exponentially\nwith time, which can be used to alter the spectrum of a lattice correlation\nfunction. We show that this property can be exploited to significantly reduce\nexcited-state contamination in the determination of matrix elements. The same\nproperty can also be used to constrain the spectral content of a correlation\nfunction and has the potential to form the basis of new methods to extract\nphysical information from lattice data."}

Briceño"], "title": "Implementing the finite-volume three-pion scattering formalism across all non-maximal isospins", "comment": "27 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "We present a numerical exploration of the relativistic-field-theory (RFT)\nformalism for three pions with all possible values of non-maximal isospin,\n$I_{\\pi\\pi\\pi} = 2$, $1$ and $0$. Using the generic-isospin extension of the\nRFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the\nframework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of\nthe two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with\nnon-zero total momentum $\\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results\nrestrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction\nso that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD\ncalculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for\nintrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels."}
