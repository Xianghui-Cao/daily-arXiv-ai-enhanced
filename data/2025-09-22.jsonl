We present a unified neural-network\napproach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements\ncalculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the\nlattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to\nphysical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms.\nUtilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases\nthat can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled\nmock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for\ndetermining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to\nzero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon\ntomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide\nan adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic\ndistributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization,\nadditional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and\nfuture facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider."}
