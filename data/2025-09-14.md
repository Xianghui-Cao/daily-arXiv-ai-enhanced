Main category: hep-lat

Motivation: To bridge the gap between toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian LGTs, especially with the advent of advanced quantum simulation experiments, aiming to understand flux string dynamics, quark confinement, and hadronization in a more complex setting.

Method: Tensor network methods are employed to simulate the real-time string dynamics within a 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, incorporating dynamical matter and examining various conditions including strong-coupling regime, finite baryon density, and off-resonance states.

Result: String breaking through Casimir reduction, meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a baryon blockade mechanism delaying string breaking, non-Abelian fluctuations like glueball loops and self-crossed strings, and representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances for higher-energy strings were observed.

Conclusion: The simulations provide key insights into non-Abelian phenomena, serving as an important guide for the development of future quantum simulators focused on non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement
and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have
mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the
advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to
bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one
spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time
string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter.
In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through
sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a
distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a
\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from
resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball
loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with
distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover
representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a
guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.

### [2] [Toward precise $ξ$ gauge fixing for the lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09367)

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical precision extrapolation method to approximate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing in Lattice QCD, which is validated by reproducing ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators with high accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant challenges of achieving high-precision ξ-gauge fixing on the lattice and to extend the application of Lattice QCD to off-shell partons beyond the Landau gauge, where it has been largely restricted.

Method: The authors propose an empirical precision extrapolation method based on the observed universal power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing precision. They define a bare gauge coupling and an effective ξ to validate their ξ-gauge fixing procedure.

Result: The result is that the proposed method successfully reproduces the ξ-dependent RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2% level, up to ξ ∼ 1, thereby validating the ξ-gauge fixing procedure.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the research is that the empirical precision extrapolation method can be used to effectively approximate high-precision ξ-gauge fixing, enabling more accurate calculations in Lattice QCD for off-shell partons in non-Landau gauges.

Abstract: Lattice QCD provides a first-principles framework for solving Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). However, its application to off-shell partons has been
largely restricted to the Landau gauge, as achieving high-precision $\xi$-gauge
fixing on the lattice poses significant challenges. Motivated by a universal
power-law dependence of off-shell parton matrix elements on gauge-fixing
precision in the Landau gauge, we propose an empirical precision extrapolation
method to approximate high-precision $\xi$-gauge fixing. By properly defining
the bare gauge coupling and then the effective $\xi$, we validate our
$\xi$-gauge fixing procedure by successfully reproducing the $\xi$-dependent
RI/MOM renormalization constants for local quark bilinear operators at 0.2\%
level, up to $\xi \sim 1$.
