Using a\ncombination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$\ninvariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground\nstate wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions.\nOur method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward\ngeneralization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant\nansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke\ngauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average\nWilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative\nexpansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories\nbeyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way\nthat avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group."}

To assess correctness,\nwe introduce a new diagnostic based on the configurational temperature (or\nconfigurational coupling) estimator, recently proposed as a thermodynamic\nconsistency check. We compare this criterion with the established\nNagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay test across a range of couplings and\nchemical potentials. Our results show that complex Langevin dynamics yields\nreliable results in the ordered phase (large $\\beta$), but fails in the\ndisordered phase (small $\\beta$), even when the sign problem is mild. The\nconfigurational estimator provides a clear and physics-driven reliability test\nthat complements drift-based diagnostics. These findings establish the\nestimator as a practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence, and\nhighlight its potential for broader applications in lattice field theories with\ncomplex actions."}
