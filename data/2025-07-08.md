TL;DR: A new enthalpy-based uniform lattice Boltzmann flux solver (EULBFS) is introduced for simulating liquid solidification, which accounts for volume changes due to density variations between phases. The method uses finite volume discretization and the total enthalpy equation to create a simpler and more efficient framework for phase change processes, with its effectiveness shown through various benchmark tests.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more effective and efficient numerical method for simulating liquid solidification, taking into account the effects of volume expansion and shrinkage due to the density differences between the liquid and solid phases, while also reducing the computational complexity associated with interface tracking in phase change simulations.

Method: The EULBFS establishes relationships between macroscopic governing equations and mesoscopic formal equations for temperature, flow, and phase fields. It then discretizes the macroscopic equations using the finite volume method, calculating fluxes based on these relationships. The total enthalpy equation is used to couple the temperature field with the phase fraction, simplifying the modeling of phase change processes.

Result: The proposed EULBFS demonstrates accuracy and robustness through a series of benchmark tests, including conductive freezing, three-phase Stefan problems, the freezing of a liquid film, the solidification of a static droplet, and the freezing of a droplet upon impact with a cold surface.

Conclusion: The EULBFS offers a unified, coherent, and computationally efficient solution for simulating liquid solidification, with the ability to handle additional terms via finite volume discretization, making it a flexible and straightforward approach compared to conventional lattice Boltzmann methods.

Abstract: An enthalpy-based uniform lattice Boltzmann flux solver (EULBFS) is proposed
in this paper for simulating liquid solidification, incorporating the effects
of volume expansion and shrinkage caused by density differences between liquid
and solid phases. The proposed solver first establishes the relationships
between the macroscopic governing equations and mesoscopic formal equations
that describe the temperature, flow, and phase fields. The macroscopic
governing equations are then discretized by the finite volume method (FVM),
with the corresponding fluxes calculated based on the established
relationships. In this way, it enables a unified and coherent solution
framework for all fields. In contrast to the conventional lattice Boltzmann
methods, the present approach handles additional terms directly via finite
volume discretization, offering a more straightforward and flexible
formulation. Furthermore, the use of the total enthalpy equation to couple the
temperature field with the phase fraction allows for efficient modeling of
phase change processes, significantly reducing the computational complexity
associated with interface tracking. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
solver are demonstrated by a series of benchmark tests, including the
conductive freezing problem, the three-phase Stefan problem, the freezing of a
liquid film in a two-dimensional container, the solidification of a static
droplet on a cold surface, and the freezing of a droplet upon impact with a
cold surface.
