The analysis focuses on\nsystematically obtaining these eigenvalues to understand better the behavior of\nthe pion under different kinematic conditions. Once extracted, these energy\neigenvalues obtained through plateau fitting of the Energy vs Time graph, are\nutilized to plot the dispersion relation of the pion. This resulting dispersion\nrelation is then compared with theoretical predictions to assess the accuracy\nand validity of the computational approach. The comparison provides insights\ninto how well the lattice QCD simulations align with established theoretical\nexpectations, and what range of kinematic variables are reliable."}

Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a\nsingle Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical\nevidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and\nthis depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As\nsuch, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum\nlimit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero\nmodes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define\nan expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition\nfunctions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has\na non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a\nnon-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the\nspectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the\nsize of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but\nthe emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited\nin finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These\nresults motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces\nthe correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition\nfunction."}
