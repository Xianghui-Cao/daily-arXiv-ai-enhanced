A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models."}

A previous study using $N_\\mathrm{f}\\in[2,6]$ mass-degenerate, unimproved staggered quark flavours on $N_τ\\in\\{4,6,8\\}$ lattices found that the bare mass regions displaying explicit first-order transitions shrink to zero, with their critical boundary line terminating in a tricritical point before the continuum limit is reached. Here we perform an analogous study for fixed imaginary baryon chemical potential and find the same behaviour: first-order regions observed on coarse lattices disappear in tricritical points with diminishing lattice spacing. These observations are consistent with currently available results from improved staggered discretisations, both at zero and non-zero imaginary chemical potential. Unless additional first-order transitions are found on finer lattices or with chiral lattice actions, this implies a second-order transition in the continuum chiral limit for all these cases, at zero and imaginary chemical potential. Ultimately, implications for the $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ QCD phase diagram at the physical point are discussed."}
