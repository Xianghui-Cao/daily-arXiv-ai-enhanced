TL;DR: The study investigates the free energy and angular momentum of rotating hot gluon matter using SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory simulations, finding that specific deformation, like the moment of inertia, is negative at temperatures above the phase transition and becomes positive at higher temperatures.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of rotating hot gluon matter, specifically its free energy and angular momentum, by employing first-principle numerical simulations. The researchers aim to determine the specific moment of inertia and specific deformation as key properties under a range of temperatures and spatial boundary conditions.

Method: The method used involves first-principle numerical simulations of the SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory to calculate the specific moment of inertia and specific deformation of the gluon matter. These calculations are performed over a broad temperature range and with various spatial boundary conditions, considering the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity.

Result: The results show that the specific deformation, similar to the moment of inertia, exhibits negative values in the temperature region above the phase transition and switches to positive values at higher temperatures. This suggests a change in the physical properties of the gluon matter with increasing temperature.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this work is that there is a distinct change in the specific deformation of rotating hot gluon matter as the temperature increases beyond the phase transition point, indicating a shift in the material's response to rotation and temperature.

Abstract: We study the free energy and the angular momentum of rotating hot gluon matter using first-principle numerical simulations of the $\textrm{SU}(3)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory. We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures.
