Our supervised regression framework is trained on Wilson-clover ensembles with the Iwasaki gauge action, and we explore two input feature scenarios: one using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ and another relying solely on gauge observables (plaquette and rectangle), enabling a fully feature-based prediction pipeline. Using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ both as a physical input to cumulant construction and as a feature for predicting higher powers, we find that even with $\\sim1\\%$ labeled data, the resulting susceptibility, skewness, and kurtosis remain statistically consistent with fully measured baselines, reducing computational cost to about $26\\%$. In the feature-only approach, where correlations rather than explicit stochastic traces drive the predictions, bias correction plays a more pronounced role. We quantify this impact through multi ensemble reweighting across nearby quark masses. Our results demonstrate that bias-corrected ML estimates can significantly reduce measurement overhead while preserving the stability of higher-order observables relevant for locating the QCD critical endpoint.

The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory."}
