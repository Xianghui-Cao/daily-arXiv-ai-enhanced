### [2] [Nucleon Parton Distribution Functions from Boosted Correlations in the Coulomb gauge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11283)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the Coulomb gauge method in lattice QCD to compute nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs) without Wilson lines, using the Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). The study shows promising results for valence-quark PDFs and suggests that the discrepancies in full-quark-channel PDFs may be due to excited-state contamination.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations by avoiding the use of Wilson lines and instead utilizing the Coulomb gauge method within LaMET to calculate nucleon PDFs, including unpolarized, helicity, and transversity distributions.

Method: The researchers implemented the Coulomb gauge method on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with specific parameters, such as lattice spacing, volume, and pion mass. They used boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV to extract PDFs from both the real and imaginary parts of the correlators.

Result: Valence-quark PDFs, derived from the real part of the correlators, showed good convergence and compatibility with recent global analyses. However, full-quark-channel PDFs, obtained from the imaginary part, exhibited discrepancies at lower momenta, which are likely due to excited-state contamination.

Conclusion: The Coulomb gauge approach has demonstrated its potential for accurately computing nucleon PDFs, particularly for valence-quark distributions. The observed discrepancies in the full-quark-channel PDFs suggest areas for further investigation, especially regarding the control of excited-state effects.

Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.

### [3] [Study of multi-particle states with tensor renormalization group method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12025)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Researchers used a spectroscopy scheme and tensor renormalization group method to investigate multi-particle states in the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, identifying one-, two-, and three-particle states and computing the two-particle scattering phase shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model by using a combination of a spectroscopy scheme and the tensor renormalization group method, which allows for the identification of the number of particles in the energy eigenstates and the computation of the scattering phase shift.

Method: The method involves computing the finite-volume energy spectrum from the transfer matrix, numerically estimated with a coarse-grained tensor network. The quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates are identified using system symmetries and interpolating operator matrix elements. Energy is plotted as a function of system size to determine the particle count. Two-particle scattering phase shifts are computed using Lüscher's formula and the wave function approach.

Result: The result is the successful identification of one-, two-, and three-particle states within the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, along with the calculation of the two-particle scattering phase shift, which is compared against exact predictions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method is effective in analyzing multi-particle states in the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model, providing insights into the scattering properties of the system.

Abstract: We investigate the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model using a spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method. We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using Lüscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction.
