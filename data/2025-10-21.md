### [1] [Electromagnetic form factors and structure of the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17549)

TL;DR: This paper presents the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors for the exotic tetraquark T_bb, providing evidence that it is a bound state with a compact heavy diquark and a light antidiquark. The charge radius of T_bb is smaller than the combined charge radii of B and B* mesons, and the electric charge form factors of B and B* are also determined.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to provide the first lattice QCD calculation of the electromagnetic form factors for the exotic tetraquark T_bb (bb˙u˙d) with quantum numbers I(J^P) = 0(1^+), which will help in understanding its internal structure, including charge distribution and magnetic dipole moments.

Method: The method used in this paper involves lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) computations on a single CLS ensemble with N_f = 2+1 dynamical quarks, using a lattice spacing of about 0.064 fm at a pion mass of approximately 290 MeV. The researchers extracted form factors that encode information about the internal structure of the T_bb tetraquark.

Result: The results show that the T_bb tetraquark has a significantly smaller charge radius compared to the combined charge radii of B and B* mesons, suggesting it is a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark [bb] and a light antidiquark [˙u ˙d]. The study also provides separate determinations of the magnetic dipole moments for the light and heavy quarks within the T_bb tetraquark, as well as the electric charge form factors for the B and B* mesons.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this work is that the T_bb tetraquark is likely a bound state with a specific configuration of a compact heavy diquark and a light antidiquark, and it possesses a smaller charge radius than the sum of the B and B* meson charge radii. This finding supports the idea of T_bb being an exotic hadron with a unique internal structure.

Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form
factors of the exotic tetraquark $T_{bb} \ (bb \bar u \bar d)$ with quantum
numbers $I( J^P ) = 0( 1^+ )$. The extracted form factors encode information
about its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the
magnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks.
Our results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a
compact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light
antidiquark $[\bar u \bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge
radius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined
charge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying
threshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge
form factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single
CLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of
approximately $a \approx0.064 \ \mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\pi \approx
290 \ \mathrm{MeV}$.

Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD determination of the nucleon gluon parton
distribution function (PDF) within the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET)
framework, employing the hybrid scheme with self renormalization, in the
continuum limit. High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \approx
2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \approx \{ 0.15, 0.12,
0.09 \}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_\pi \approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark
flavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\mathcal{T}_\text{W} = 3a^2$,
finding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix
elements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a
\approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit. Our
final LaMET gluon PDF compares reasonably with select global-fit
determinations, specifically preferring analyses which have near-zero gluonic
density in the $x \gtrsim 0.6$ region.
