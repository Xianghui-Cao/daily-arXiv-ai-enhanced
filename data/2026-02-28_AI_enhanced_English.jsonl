The width of the strings scales logarithmically with the string length again for all $g^2$-values, providing evidence for a rough string, with no indication for a roughening transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores a non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice, using tensor network methods. It finds the theory to be confining and detects a Luescher term with an unexpected value for the dimensionless constant \u03b3. The string width scales logarithmically with length, suggesting a rough string without a roughening transition.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of a non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions, specifically its confinement properties and the characteristics of the quark potential, including the presence of a Luescher term and the nature of the string between quarks.", "method": "The method involves applying tensor network techniques to the non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model on a hexagonal lattice to calculate the static quark potential and analyze the Luescher term as well as the scaling of the string width with the string length.", "result": "The results show that the theory exhibits confinement, a Luescher term is present but with a \u03b3 value that deviates from the expected -\u03c0/24, and the strings are rough, with their width increasing logarithmically with length, indicating no roughening transition.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the non-Abelian SU(2) quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice is confining, has an anomalous Luescher term, and displays rough strings without a roughening transition, which provides insights into the low-energy behavior of the model."}}

Hadron interactions have therefore become a key focus. In these proceedings, I review the current state of the art and recent advances in methods for studying hadron interactions via finite-volume spectroscopy and finite-volume quantization conditions. I will also review recent spectroscopy studies and results presented at Lattice 2025, with a focus on charmed mesons, the doubly charmed tetraquark, and the doubly bottom tetraquark.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper reviews the current state and recent advancements in methods for studying hadron interactions, with a focus on lattice QCD calculations of resonances and bound states.
