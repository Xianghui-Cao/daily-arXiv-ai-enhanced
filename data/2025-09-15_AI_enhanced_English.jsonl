Solving the Hermitian positive definite\nsystems, which are sparse but ill-conditioned, involves using iterative\nmethods, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which are time-consuming and\ncomputationally expensive. Preconditioners can effectively accelerate this\nprocess, with the state-of-the-art being multigrid preconditioners. However,\nconstructing useful preconditioners can be challenging, adding additional\ncomputational overhead, especially in large linear systems. We propose a\nframework, leveraging operator learning techniques, to construct linear maps as\neffective preconditioners. The method in this work does not rely on explicit\nmatrices from either the original linear systems or the produced\npreconditioners, allowing efficient model training and application in the CG\nsolver. In the context of the Schwinger model U(1) gauge theory in 1+1\nspacetime dimensions with two degenerate-mass fermions), this preconditioning\nscheme effectively decreases the condition number of the linear systems and\napproximately halves the number of iterations required for convergence in\nrelevant parameter ranges. We further demonstrate the framework learns a\ngeneral mapping dependent on the lattice structure which leads to zero-shot\nlearning ability for the Dirac operators constructed from gauge field\nconfigurations of different sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new framework using operator learning techniques to construct preconditioners for accelerating the solution of linear systems in lattice QCD, which reduces the condition number and halves the iterations needed for convergence.

Additionally, the learned preconditioner can be applied to Dirac operators of different sizes without additional training, showcasing its zero-shot learning capability.", "conclusion": "The introduction of an operator learning-based preconditioning framework offers a promising approach to accelerate the solution of linear systems in lattice QCD, with potential for broad applicability across various system sizes and configurations."}}
