### [1] [Robust Perspective Correction for Real-World Crack Evolution Tracking in Image-Based Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22437)
*Xinxin Sun,Peter Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性扩散和RANSAC算法实现高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和纹理复杂场景下表现不佳，需要一种更适应裂纹定位的解决方案。

Method: 采用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留的尺度空间，结合RANSAC估计单应性变换，无需训练或参数调整。

Result: 在多种实际条件下，裂纹面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂纹演化跟踪提供了一种鲁棒、轻量且物理基础明确的解决方案，适用于移动平台和无人机部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 结合害虫检测网络、图像质量评估、图像复杂度评估和害虫分布均匀性评估，设计多因素敏感性分析选择最优评估方法，并采用回归模型预测计数置信度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在害虫计数置信度测试集上，MSE降低了31.7%，R2提高了15.2%，优于仅基于计数结果的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究首次全面评估了计数任务的置信度，并通过模型量化了影响因素与计数置信度的关系，为精准农业决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDiff是一种创新的扩散模型加速框架，通过调制量化和误差补偿提高生成效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高，现有加速技术（如缓存和量化）在计算误差和生成质量上存在局限。

Method: 提出MoDiff框架，结合调制量化和误差补偿，适用于所有扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和LSUN上实验显示，MoDiff将激活量化从8位降至3位且性能无损。

Conclusion: MoDiff为扩散模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

### [4] [ViFusionTST: Deep Fusion of Time-Series Image Representations from Load Signals for Early Bed-Exit Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22498)
*Hao Liu,Yu Hu,Rakiba Rayhana,Ling Bai,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低成本负载传感器的床离意图预测方法，通过图像融合和时间序列分类实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院和长期护理机构中床相关跌倒事故频发，现有警报系统反应滞后，需提前预测床离意图以减少伤害。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器采集信号，转换为互补图像（RGB线图和三种纹理图），并设计双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）进行并行处理和跨模态融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法是一种实用且有效的实时隐私保护跌倒预防解决方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

### [5] [Scalable Dynamic Origin-Destination Demand Estimation Enhanced by High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22499)
*Jiachao Liu,Pablo Guarda,Koichiro Niinuma,Sean Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卫星影像与传统交通数据的多类别动态起讫点需求估计框架，显著提升了无本地传感器路段的估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统本地传感器数据稀疏且覆盖有限，卫星影像提供城市范围的交通信息，弥补数据不足。

Method: 设计计算机视觉流程提取车辆类别信息，构建计算图模型联合校准交通流量与旅行时间。

Result: 实验表明，卫星数据显著提升估计性能，框架适用于大规模网络。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际部署潜力，尤其适用于不同规模城市。

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

### [6] [Visual-Semantic Knowledge Conflicts in Operating Rooms: Synthetic Data Curation for Surgical Risk Perception in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22500)
*Weiyi Zhao,Xiaoyu Tan,Liang Liu,Sijia Li,Youwei Song,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对手术室风险检测的数据集OR-VSKC，通过合成图像和人工标注解决视觉-语义知识冲突问题，并验证了微调MLLMs的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全至关重要，但现有MLLMs在视觉安全违规检测中存在视觉-语义知识冲突（VS-KC）问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成34,000张合成图像和214张人工标注图像构建OR-VSKC数据集，并微调MLLMs以检测VS-KC。

Result: 微调显著提升了MLLMs对训练冲突实体的检测能力，但对未训练实体类型表现不佳。

Conclusion: OR-VSKC数据集和基准测试为研究VS-KC提供了资源，未来需更全面的训练以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at
https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.

Result: 模型在分类准确性和泛化能力上有所提升。

Conclusion: SpatialNet-ViT为遥感分类任务提供了一种更通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing datasets offer significant promise for tackling key
classification tasks such as land-use categorization, object presence
detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

### [8] [What Makes a Dribble Successful? Insights From 3D Pose Tracking Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22503)
*Michiel Schepers,Pieter Robberechts,Jan Van Haaren,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二维位置数据无法全面捕捉盘带技能（如平衡和方向控制），限制了分析深度。

Method: 从2022/23赛季欧冠的1,736次盘带中提取姿态特征，并结合传统2D数据评估其对盘带成功的影响。

Result: 姿态特征（攻击者平衡和攻防方向对齐）对预测盘带成功有显著作用，结合2D数据可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 三维姿态数据为足球盘带分析提供了新视角，补充了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Motivation: 脑部病变检测对诊断和治疗至关重要，但监督学习方法需要标注数据。本文旨在开发一种无监督方法，从正常MRI图像中学习，以检测异常组织。

Method: 使用神经网络模型从正常MRI图像中学习，将图像块映射回其空间位置。异常块通过预测误差或方差较高来检测，生成热图用于精细分割。

Result: 在多个数据集（BraTS2021、MSLUB、ATLAS、WMH）上验证，Patch2Loc在无监督分割中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch2Loc是一种有效的无监督脑部异常检测方法，适用于多种MRI图像，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Result: 在声纳图像和自然图像上表现优于无监督基线方法，且无需预训练网络或对抗性判别器。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督条件下有效，适用于多种图像领域，代码已开源。

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Conclusion: DNA方法无需训练即可实现域适应，为扩散密集预测模型提供了高效的域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IMU系统在磁干扰环境下容易产生方向估计错误，限制了实际应用。

Method: MagShield采用“检测-纠正”策略，通过多IMU联合分析检测磁干扰，并利用人体运动先验纠正方向错误。

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的运动捕捉准确性，并与多种稀疏惯性MoCap系统兼容。

Conclusion: MagShield有效解决了磁干扰问题，提升了稀疏惯性MoCap系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

*Aditya Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种自动化框架，用于现代射线照相中的缺陷检测和组织，基于NDE 4.0标准。通过虚拟缺陷增强和数据扩展技术优化数据集，并利用改进的U-net模型实现语义分割。结果显示该方法在缺陷检测中表现优异，速度快且实用性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代射线照相中信息不足的问题，优化虚拟缺陷增强技术，并验证框架的可行性。

Method: 收集并分类223张飞机焊缝的CR照片，使用虚拟缺陷增强和标准增强技术扩展数据，训练改进的U-net模型进行语义分割。

Result: 模型在缺陷检测中表现出高敏感度，扩展方法效果显著，处理速度快，适用于大图像分析。

Conclusion: 该框架在实际测试中表现出潜力，可作为支持工具，不受设备和软件限制。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

*Yida Wang,Xueyang Zhang,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一的神经表面重建框架，解决了多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强导致的结构退化问题。通过微分可见性验证、平面共形正则化和物理基础的Eikonal松弛，实现了几何与外观的协同优化，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以兼顾几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强的问题。

Method: 1) 基于SDF引导的光线追踪实现微分可见性验证；2) 通过射线对齐的几何块进行平面共形正则化；3) 基于局部辐射梯度的物理基础Eikonal松弛。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离降低21.4%，PSNR提升2.32 dB，能够恢复镜面物体、厘米级城市布局和无纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化几何与外观约束，实现了高性能的表面重建，并展示了在逆渲染任务中的通用性。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集装箱长期使用易受损，及时检测损伤对安全和延长使用寿命至关重要。

Method: 使用278张标注图像训练和测试三种模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和Yolov12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中更具优势，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Preserve Anything”的新方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中的对象保存和语义一致性问题，通过N-channel ControlNet实现高保真度和用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多对象保存、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用N-channel ControlNet，结合对象保存、背景引导和高频覆盖模块，确保细节保留和语义一致性。

Result: 在FID（15.26）和CLIP-S（32.85）指标上表现优异，用户研究显示在多个维度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多对象保存、语义一致性和用户控制方面取得了突破，性能显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

*Abhineet Singh,Nilanjan Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文改进了Pix2Seq目标检测器，将其扩展到视频领域，提出了一种新的端到端视频目标检测方法，解决了传统检测器的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频目标检测方法依赖2D框链接和启发式后处理，存在计算资源限制和性能瓶颈。本文旨在通过序列化表示和3D框输出解决这些问题。

Method: 将视频对象表示为可变长度的离散标记序列，直接输出3D框或轨迹，避免传统2D框链接方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于静态Pix2Seq检测器，并在UA-DETRAC上与当前最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频目标检测中表现优越，但受计算资源限制，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，解决了数据稀缺和异构性问题，在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，限制了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，然后从9个教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个生物医学数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在6类任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法，适用于实际数据限制场景。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Motivation: 农业图像语义分割对精准农业至关重要，但现有方法在效率和性能上存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Dual Atrous Separable Convolution (DAS Conv)模块，优化膨胀率和填充大小，并结合跳跃连接提升细粒度特征捕捉能力。

Result: 模型在Agriculture Vision数据集上性能接近复杂Transformer模型，效率提升66%。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业遥感图像分割提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对多学科研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名。

Method: LIGHT整合几何、视觉和语言特征，通过几何感知嵌入模块和多模态学习预测文本阅读顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT展示了其优势。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Motivation: 现有方法（如CNN或Transformer）难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂时空关系，BrainMT旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段设计：1）双向Mamba块捕获全局时间交互；2）Transformer块建模空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类和回归任务中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: BrainMT为fMRI数据分析提供了高效且强大的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强大型多模态模型在像素级任务（如前景分割）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用GRPO策略训练模型，生成点与边界框提示，结合SAM2生成分割掩码。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，零样本任务中RefCOCOg和ReasonSeg分别达到71.4 cIoU和56.7 gIoU。

Conclusion: Seg-R1展示了纯强化学习训练在像素级任务中的高效性和泛化能力，无需复杂模型修改或文本监督。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在视觉和语言数据整合中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉输入不符的文本。研究发现这是由于模型对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的‘记忆消退效应’。

Method: 提出ReCo模块，基于几何代数和关系组合，可附加于任何VLM上，无需其他修改。

Result: 在三种主流VLM（InstructBLIP、LlaVA、MiniGPT4）上验证，性能在多基准测试中提升，并与其他减少幻觉的方法兼容。

Conclusion: ReCo模块能有效缓解幻觉问题，且兼容性强，为VLM的改进提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,

over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly transformed the field of
3D shape generation, enabling the synthesis of complex, diverse, and
semantically meaningful 3D objects. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of the current state of the art in 3D shape generation, organizing the
discussion around three core components: shape representations, generative
modeling approaches, and evaluation protocols. We begin by categorizing 3D
representations into explicit, implicit, and hybrid setups, highlighting their
structural properties, advantages, and limitations. Next, we review a wide
range of generation methods, focusing on feedforward architectures. We further
summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics that assess fidelity,
diversity, and realism of generated shapes. Finally, we identify open
challenges and outline future research directions that could drive progress in
controllable, efficient, and high-quality 3D shape generation. This survey aims
to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners seeking a
structured and in-depth understanding of this rapidly evolving field.

Result: 实验表明，LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中能以最小复杂度实现优异性能。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性是盲超分辨率模型设计的关键，LightBSR在性能和效率上均表现出色。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

*Jun-Jee Chao,Qingyuan Jiang,Volkan Isler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种联合解决部分分割和运动估计的方法，基于3D高斯表示，适用于点云序列中动态采样的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态采样点云序列中，传统基于点对应的方法不适用的问题。

Method: 使用3D高斯表示物体，通过时间依赖的旋转、平移和尺度参数化，实现部分分割和运动估计。

Result: 在遮挡情况下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，且对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在动态采样点云序列中表现优越，尤其适用于遮挡场景。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种确定性方法，用于高效估计6D姿态置信区域，解决了采样方法的速度和区域过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于采样的6D姿态置信区域估计方法存在速度慢和置信区域过大的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准高斯关键点分布，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著减小。

Conclusion: 该方法提供紧凑的置信区域，覆盖真实姿态，且计算效率高，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘系统中深度学习训练受限于传感器数据不足和资源限制，现有方法存在模态偏移和高资源需求问题。

Method: XTransfer通过模型修复（修复模态偏移）和层重组（高效搜索和重组源模型层）实现资源高效的模型迁移。

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中表现优异，显著降低了数据收集、训练和部署成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统提供了一种高效、适应性强的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

TL;DR: UniFuse是一个多模态医学图像融合框架，通过降解感知提示学习模块和Omni统一特征表示方案，解决了图像未对齐或质量差的问题，实现了对齐、恢复和融合的一体化优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设源图像高质量且对齐，实际应用中常因图像未对齐或质量差导致效果下降。

Method: 嵌入降解感知提示学习模块，设计Omni统一特征表示方案和Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion模块，利用ALSN实现自适应特征表示。

Result: 在多数据集上验证了UniFuse的有效性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniFuse成功统一了对齐、恢复和融合任务，为多模态医学图像融合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 彩色点云是3D应用的主流表示，但生成大规模且密集的彩色点云仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出JGAU框架，包括几何上采样网络和属性上采样网络，并引入两种粗属性上采样方法（GDWAI和DLAI）及属性增强模块。

Result: JGAU在不同上采样率下的PSNR显著优于现有方法，平均提升2.11至2.47分贝。

Conclusion: JGAU方法在彩色点云上采样任务中表现出色，显著提升了生成点云的质量。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练模型的金属透镜摄影方法，通过多路径扩散和伪数据增强实现高保真图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属透镜在计算成像中潜力巨大，但面临光学退化和计算恢复的挑战，现有方法依赖精确校准或大量配对数据，难以实际应用。

Method: 采用多路径扩散框架（正、中、负提示路径）和伪数据增强，结合可调解码器和空间变化退化感知注意力模块（SVDA）。

Result: 方法优于现有技术，实现高保真和锐利的图像重建，并通过毫米级MetaCamera验证。

Conclusion: 该方法无需大量数据，通过预训练模型和可控推理过程，有效解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Conclusion: RoboPearls能够高效生成逼真仿真，并通过自动化工具提升机器人学习性能。

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

Conclusion: VSRM为视频超分辨率任务提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云与图像之间的模态差异和单帧LiDAR的稀疏性及噪声是配准任务的主要挑战，现有方法难以有效解决。

Method: 将LiDAR强度图投影为2D视图，输入基于注意力的无检测器匹配网络，并引入可重复性评分机制提升匹配可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR条件下实现了最先进的性能，为跨模态配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

Result: 在公开数据集上，RGE-GS在重建质量上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过创新方法显著提升了重建质量和训练效率，代码将开源。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

Motivation: 深度学习模型复杂化导致解释性下降，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅停留在样本层面。

Method: 利用CBM框架近似黑盒推理，通过全局梯度贡献识别并修正有害概念，将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: CPE通过非线性模块和对抗训练，实现了更高效和鲁棒的概念擦除。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDGT是一种频率自适应动态图变换器，通过整合频率自适应处理、动态图学习和多尺度时间解缠网络，显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑电图（EEG）在情绪识别中因个体差异导致的跨被试泛化问题。

Method: 结合频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN），动态加权情绪相关频段并学习特定输入的脑连接模式。

Result: 实验证明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过整合频率、空间和时间建模，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的自动图像裁剪方法，支持提取多个非重叠区域，改进了传统单区域裁剪的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于显著性的裁剪方法只能优化单个边界框，无法满足需要多个不连续裁剪区域的应用需求。

Method: 扩展了固定宽高比裁剪算法，动态调整注意力阈值并避免重复计算显著图，实现线性时间内的多区域裁剪。

Result: 方法能够高效提取多个非重叠裁剪区域，并展示了定性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为多区域裁剪提供了有效解决方案，并提出了未来数据集和基准测试的可能性。

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions
while preserving essential composition elements. Traditional saliency-aware
cropping methods optimize a single bounding box, making them ineffective for
applications requiring multiple disjoint crops. In this work, we extend the
Fixed Aspect Ratio Cropping algorithm to efficiently extract multiple
non-overlapping crops in linear time. Our approach dynamically adjusts
attention thresholds and removes selected crops from consideration without
recomputing the entire saliency map. We discuss qualitative results and
introduce the potential for future datasets and benchmarks.

TL;DR: MVOV3D是一种新方法，通过减少多视图融合中的固有噪声，提升开放词汇3D场景理解的性能，无需训练即可增强通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限词汇量的基准测试中表现良好，但难以处理多样化的对象类别，且3D数据量有限限制了开放词汇3D模型的训练。

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器的精确区域级图像和文本特征，结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合，减少噪声。

Result: 在ScanNet200和Matterport160数据集上，MVOV3D分别实现了14.7%和16.2%的mIoU，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进视觉语言模型（VLM）在测试时提示调整（TPT）中的校准问题的方法，通过初始化提示和使用正则化损失来提高校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPT方法在提高准确性的同时会导致置信度校准下降，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。

Method: 1. 使用大型语言模型（LLM）初始化提示以避免过拟合；2. 提出一种正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了预期校准误差（ECE），平均ECE为4.11，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TPT中的校准问题，提升了VLM在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于听众增强的GRPO框架，通过重新评估推理链生成校准置信分数，显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在泛化和避免记忆化方面表现不佳，需要复杂标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能改善泛化，但在推理链与独立视觉语言模型矛盾时准确性下降。

Method: 引入听众增强的GRPO框架，听众模型重新评估推理链并提供校准置信分数，优化强化学习奖励信号。

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，大规模人类偏好数据集上OOD性能提升6%，减少推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好对齐提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

TL;DR: SemFaceEdit是一种基于生成辐射流形的新方法，通过语义场实现面部图像的局部编辑，同时保持其他区域的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D感知GAN技术在局部编辑能力上的不足，提供更精细的面部语义编辑。

Method: 结合几何模块和外观模块，生成语义辐射场和RGB辐射场，并通过对抗训练实现语义感知的几何和外观解耦。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部语义编辑提供了一种高效且精确的方法。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: FOCUS通过自适应提取属性级特征，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能，并能泛化到未见属性。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) across aerial and ground vantage points has
become crucial for large-scale surveillance and public safety applications.
Although significant progress has been made in ground-only scenarios, bridging
the aerial-ground domain gap remains a formidable challenge due to extreme
viewpoint differences, scale variations, and occlusions. Building upon the
achievements of the AG-ReID 2023 Challenge, this paper introduces the AG-VPReID

featured four international teams. These teams developed solutions ranging from
multi-stream architectures to transformer-based temporal reasoning and
physics-informed modeling. The leading approach, X-TFCLIP from UAM, attained
72.28% Rank-1 accuracy in the aerial-to-ground ReID setting and 70.77% in the
ground-to-aerial ReID setting, surpassing existing baselines while highlighting

Conclusion: DMD-Net是一种高效、鲁棒的网格去噪方法，适用于高噪声环境。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，而RES在大规模图像集合中计算成本高，MaTIR旨在统一两者，实现高效检索和精确分割。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段利用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP离线生成对象掩码和区域级嵌入；第二阶段使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）重新排序和对象定位。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，MaTIR在检索准确性和分割质量上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR成功统一了TIR和RES，通过两阶段框架实现了高效且精确的图像检索和对象分割。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的工业场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导的视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动失真和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR评分，结合潜在优化框架和潜在掩码生成视频。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在显著领域转换时表现优异。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过优化时空像素相关性建模，显著提升了视频编辑的时空一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）在分割模型中直接融合特征，导致动态视觉信息与静态语义的纠缠，降低了分割准确性。

Method: 1. 设计预训练范式，将文本标签转换为点级提示并生成文本掩码；2. 使用线性投影将大语言模型生成的隐藏状态解耦为文本和视觉特征子空间；3. 动态掩码融合策略结合解耦特征。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合，显著提升了分割和接地任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习的语义信息度量方法，用于量化图像和文本之间的信息增益，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的语义信息度量，重新定义信息增益概念，并验证其与嵌入范数的相关性。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益与嵌入范数强相关（R² 0.98-1.00），低信息增益图像多为占位图标。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为跨模态信息量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

TL;DR: CP-Guard是一个针对协作感知（CP）的统一防御框架，通过概率无关的样本共识和在线自适应阈值技术，有效检测并消除恶意代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作感知在多代理系统中提升感知性能，但易受恶意代理攻击，需开发防御机制。

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测恶意代理，提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了一种可靠且自适应的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在MedVQA中常生成错误答案，且检索增强方法可能引入无关信息，忽略多模态上下文。

Method: 提出MOTOR方法，利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索重排序，结合接地标题和最优传输技术。

Result: 在MedVQA数据集上，MOTOR平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态上下文检索显著提升了MedVQA的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D point cloud data, driven by applications in autonomous
driving, robotics, and immersive environments, has led to criticals demand for
efficient compression and quality assessment techniques. Unlike traditional 2D
media, point clouds present unique challenges due to their irregular structure,
high data volume, and complex attributes. This paper provides a comprehensive
survey of recent advances in point cloud compression (PCC) and point cloud
quality assessment (PCQA), emphasizing their significance for real-time and
perceptually relevant applications. We analyze a wide range of handcrafted and
learning-based PCC algorithms, along with objective PCQA metrics. By
benchmarking representative methods on emerging datasets, we offer detailed
comparisons and practical insights into their strengths and limitations.
Despite notable progress, challenges such as enhancing visual fidelity,
reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines
future directions, including hybrid compression frameworks and advanced feature
extraction strategies, to enable more efficient, immersive, and intelligent 3D
applications.

TL;DR: VPT是一种参数高效的微调技术，通过输入空间的提示学习适应预训练ViT。研究发现数据分布的非高斯性影响提示学习，提出白化方法加速学习并提升性能。进一步提出BPT方法，性能更优且参数更少。

Motivation: 解决视觉提示调优（VPT）中因数据分布非高斯性导致的提示学习困难问题。

Method: 提出白化数据方法，并基于此设计BPT（双线性提示调优），通过低秩分解减少参数。

Result: BPT显著加速提示学习并提升准确率（如CUB数据集提升>25分），且参数和计算开销更低。

Conclusion: BPT方法在性能和效率上均优于现有VPT方法，为视觉Transformer调优提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Motivation: 多模态内容的真实性提升使得虚假信息更隐蔽，尤其是在双语字幕新闻中，局部图像编辑和跨语言不一致性共同扭曲含义。

Method: BiMi结合区域级定位、跨模态和跨语言一致性检测，并引入在线检索模块和GRPO优化解释质量。

Conclusion: BiMi在现实多语言虚假信息检测中表现优异，并发布了BiMiBench基准数据集和工具。

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be
released.

TL;DR: 欧盟报告预测到2026年90%的在线内容可能是AI生成的，引发对政治虚假信息的担忧。加州AB 3211法案要求对AI生成内容加水印，但现有水印技术易被篡改。本文提出PECCAVI，一种抗视觉转述攻击的无失真图像水印技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水印技术易被篡改和绕过的问题，尤其是针对新兴的视觉转述攻击。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声抛光技术保护非熔化点（NMPs），增强水印的耐久性。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵抗视觉转述攻击，且不引入图像失真。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为AI生成内容的水印保护提供了更安全、耐久的解决方案，且代码将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务中，现有对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉关键时间结构的问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过DTW在共享嵌入空间对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准上达到30.5%准确率，优于十亿参数视频语言模型，且参数量少8倍。

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，可扩展且通用地释放视觉语言模型在细粒度视频理解中的潜力。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法在GFSS中因确定性限制而难以适应多样样本，尤其是标注稀缺的新类别。

Method: FewCLIP结合原型校准机制和分布正则化，通过可学习的视觉校准原型优化冻结的文本原型，实现更自适应和判别性的表示。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上，FewCLIP显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准有效提升了GFSS的性能，尤其在数据稀缺的新类别上表现优异。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

*Xinrong Hu,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AugPaint是一种基于潜在扩散模型的数据增强框架，通过修复技术从有限标注数据生成图像-标签对，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据集的像素级标注耗时且昂贵，如何在标注数据稀缺的情况下提升分割性能是关键挑战。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型进行修复任务，无需重新训练，通过反向去噪过程生成与标签掩码匹配的合成图像。

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集（CT、MRI和皮肤影像）上，AugPaint优于现有标签高效方法，显著提升分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案，生成的高质量合成图像可用于训练下游分割模型。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

*Hung Nguyen,An Le,Runfa Li,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOpti3DGS通过小波变换限制高斯增殖，提升3D高斯溅射的效率，同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在视图合成中表现优异，但高斯基元数量增长导致内存和带宽压力。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，学习高通滤波器，并通过正交性损失逐步激活细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS减少冗余高斯基元，生成更稀疏的场景表示，适用于资源受限硬件。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持视觉质量的同时，显著提升了3D高斯溅射的效率和兼容性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过统一训练方法提升多模态任务性能，突破现有模型的局限性。

Method: 采用扩散式视觉解码器和双向令牌细化器，从语言模型开始进行统一训练。

Result: 在OpenCompass、DPG-Bench、GenEval等基准测试中表现优异，超越Ristretto-3B和SAIL-VL-1.5-2B。

Conclusion: Ovis-U1在多模态理解、生成和编辑任务中实现了显著突破，为后续模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，提升小规模视觉语言模型的思维可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数容量有限和指令跟随能力弱，难以实现可靠思维。现有训练范式（SFT和RLVR）对模型要求过高，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃。

Method: 提出DyME训练范式，动态结合SFT和RLVR，确保每次优化步骤贡献于平衡。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: DyME是提升SVLMs思维可靠性的实用有效方案。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Conclusion: CoreMark为文本水印提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a
challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex

theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of
braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and
efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive
hairstyle modeling in digital humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Conclusion: DyCL为解决跨视角地理定位问题提供了有效方法，并通过公开代码和基准数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在减少图像模糊影响和区分相似脊椎方面存在不足，限制了临床应用的准确性。

Method: 使用小波变换进行无损下采样，分别处理高频和低频成分：高频部分采用高频特征细化（HFR）增强关键特征；低频部分采用多粒度状态空间模型（MG-SSM）提取多粒度上下文。

Result: 在CT和MRI脊椎分割数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMC-Net通过频率增强和多粒度上下文提取，显著提高了脊椎分割的准确性，为临床应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在三个主要问题：因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据导致扩展性差、训练目标和数据多样性不足。

Method: MoCa分为两个阶段：1）模态感知持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文推理；2）异构对比微调，利用多样化的多模态数据提升泛化和对齐能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新的最优结果，并在模型规模和训练数据上展现出强扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过引入双向注意力、利用大规模无标注数据和多样化训练目标，有效提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

TL;DR: DC-TTA通过分治策略改进SAM在复杂场景中的交互式分割表现，利用用户点击作为监督，显著提升了分割准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中表现不佳，需要一种方法提升其适应性。

Method: 提出DC-TTA框架，将用户点击分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，最后合并为统一预测器。

Result: DC-TTA在多个基准测试中显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分治策略有效解决了SAM在复杂场景中的局限性，提升了交互式分割的性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

Motivation: 多笔画字符（如中文和日文）的复杂性对非母语学习者构成挑战，简化字符可能降低学习门槛并优化字体设计。

Method: 使用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性去除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 实验表明，即使去除多个笔画，许多字符仍可区分，为简化策略提供了依据。

Conclusion: 研究展示了简化多笔画字符的潜力，为未来更系统的简化方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化显著提升了CPG任务的性能，为临床实践提供了更准确的斑块分级方法。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，内存消耗显著降低（运行时2.09GB，训练时28.5GB），性能优于资源密集型方法。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了内存效率与精度的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the
best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前城市研究方法通常局限于特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的成功为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: 通过构建多样化的城市指令数据集，并提出多阶段训练框架，分离空间推理增强与领域知识学习。

Result: 实验表明，UrbanLLaVA在单模态和跨模态任务中均优于开源和专有MLLMs，并展现出跨城市的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态处理框架，其代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理的分割框架R²S和数据集3D ReasonSeg，以增强3D点云感知的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理需要精确空间推理的复杂指令时存在挑战，尽管3D点云数据提供了详细的空间线索。

Method: R²S框架模仿人类认知过程，将空间推理分解为两个阶段：先识别相关元素，再基于视觉先验处理指令。

Result: 实验表明，R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来研究提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolumetricSMPL是一种基于神经体积的人体模型，通过动态混合权重提高计算效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表面网格模型在处理几何实体交互时效率低，现有体积神经隐式模型在复杂人体关节表现或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 利用神经混合权重（NBW）生成紧凑高效的MLP解码器，动态混合少量学习权重矩阵。

Result: 比COAP快10倍，GPU内存使用降低6倍，精度更高，支持SDF接触建模。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在多项任务中表现优异，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Method: 构建数据集并使用DINOv2模型进行检索和分类，通过微调提升检索性能。

Result: 基线方法准确率97.2%，检索精度29.0% AP；微调后检索性能提升12% AP，但准确率降至92.7%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进方向，未来研究可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出Segment Attribution Tables (SATs)，通过汇总局部显著性解释提供半全局见解，弥补全局和局部解释之间的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类中表现优异，但模型预测的可解释性仍具挑战性。现有方法要么过于局部（如显著性图），要么过于全局化，难以捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: 提出SATs方法，利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图量化其影响，揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性。

Result: SATs能够解释任何可生成显著性图的分类器，提供介于全局和局部之间的实用工具。

Conclusion: SATs填补了全局和局部解释之间的空白，为分析和调试图像分类器提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Conclusion: RoboScape为构建高效的物理信息世界模型提供了新思路，推动了具身智能研究的发展。

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在减少采样步骤时面临图像逼真度下降和计算效率的权衡问题。

Method: 提出PixelBoost模型，通过控制训练中的随机性避免局部最优，并采用Sigmoidal噪声排序方法简化训练。

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优越，边缘重建能力更强，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率任务中实现了更高的逼真度和计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

Motivation: 现有提示工程方法虽能提升图像风格，但常忽视语义对齐，导致内容不满意。

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐基准上达到最新最优性能，且具有即插即用设计。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效解决了语义对齐问题，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)解释性不足的问题，通过因果推断和高斯滤波减少冗余激活干扰，显著提升了可视化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的解释性研究不足，冗余激活干扰了模型的可信度和可视化效果，亟需一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TAM方法，结合因果推断和高斯滤波，减少上下文冗余激活对后续令牌解释的干扰。

Result: TAM在多种场景（如目标定位、失败案例分析等）中显著优于现有方法，提供了高质量的可视化结果。

Conclusion: TAM方法有效提升了MLLMs的解释性和可视化质量，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

TL;DR: AlignCVC通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失改进单图像到3D生成中的跨视图一致性（CVC），显著提升生成质量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，预训练生成模型合成的中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），严重影响3D重建性能。现有方法通过反馈重建结果改进CVC，但受限于噪声和不稳定的输出。

Method: 提出AlignCVC框架，通过分布对齐将生成和重建的多视图分布与真实多视图分布对齐，采用软-硬对齐策略分别优化生成和重建模型。

Result: 实验表明AlignCVC显著提升CVC和生成质量，推理速度可快至4步，且能无缝集成多种多视图生成与3D重建模型。

Conclusion: AlignCVC为单图像到3D生成提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，通过分布对齐显著改进跨视图一致性和生成性能。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Conclusion: AutoT2IS解决了文本到图像集生成的挑战，具有重要的实际价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了小相机运动场景下的几何表示和相机参数估计问题，提升了新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签图像上实现了高效的自监督学习，具有广泛的下游应用潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

TL;DR: MotionGPT3是一个双模态运动-语言模型，通过分离运动建模和保留语言智能，解决了运动与语言统一建模中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态模型在统一理解和生成方面取得了进展，但运动-语言模型的开发仍未充分探索。需要解决运动模态与离散表示之间的重建差距以及统一训练中语言智能的退化问题。

Method: 提出MotionGPT3，采用专家混合方法，将运动建模与语言模型分离，通过共享注意力机制实现双向信息流。使用运动变分自编码器（VAE）将运动编码为潜在表示，并通过扩散头直接预测运动潜在。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动理解和生成任务中表现优异，同时保持了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3建立了一个在自回归框架内统一的双模态运动扩散模型。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和帧相机结合的时空解耦高斯泼溅框架，用于高动态场景重建，解决了背景与动态对象时空特征不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用统一表示模型（如高斯）直接匹配动态场景的时空特征，但无法处理对象的潜在不连续时间特征和背景与对象的异质空间特征。

Method: 引入事件相机补充帧相机，提出时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架，通过聚类区分背景与对象的时空特征，并利用高斯表示与事件数据的一致性指导对象的时空解耦。

Result: 实验验证了该方法的优越性，能够提升背景与对象的时空区分度，实现时间连续的动态场景渲染。

Conclusion: 时空解耦的高斯泼溅框架有效解决了高动态场景重建中的时空特征不匹配问题，为动态场景表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器显著加速隐式神经表示（INR）的视频编码，同时保持重建质量和坐标级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决INR编码速度慢的问题，同时避免牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制。

Method: SIEDD采用共享编码器捕获全局低频特征，再并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，编码速度提升20-30倍，保持竞争性重建质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络生成的人脸伪造技术日益复杂，检测数字媒体中的人脸伪造成为重要挑战，现有模型在面对未见过的伪造技术时表现不佳。

Method: 采用三元组学习和Siamese网络架构，结合域对抗训练和伪造判别器，避免过拟合特定伪造技术的特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试和消融研究中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: Trident框架在检测多样伪造技术上表现出色，具有较高的泛化能力。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: HAMW有效提升transformer模型的高频特征提取能力，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能明确建模全局最优传输路径，且受限于体素空间分辨率，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状至紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最优性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过优化全局传输和潜在空间操作，显著提升了3D形状补全的细节生成和分辨率适应性。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参考图像修复方法在时间变体图像（即同一场景但时间间隔较大的图像）上效果不佳，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了InDiTE模块和InDiTE-Diff方法，结合扩散模型和潜在交叉参考，提升时间变体图像的修复效果。

Result: 实验表明，InDiTE-Diff在TAMP任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff为时间变体图像修复提供了一种有效解决方案，并构建了新的数据集TAMP-Street。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Motivation: 现有RGB-only SLAM系统过度依赖光度渲染损失，在视角和光照变化剧烈的户外环境中表现不佳。

Method: 引入三视图匹配模块和混合几何约束，结合光度损失进行相机跟踪；提出概率初始化策略和动态衰减机制优化映射。

Result: 在多个户外数据集上表现优异，显著降低轨迹误差（ATE减少69.0%），并达到最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep

incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种智能系统，用于同时实现自动平面定位和先天性子宫异常（CUA）诊断，结合去噪扩散模型和强化学习框架，显著提升了诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先天性子宫异常（CUAs）可能导致不孕、流产和妊娠并发症，传统2D超声无法清晰显示子宫形态，3D超声虽能重建冠状面，但仍需智能系统提升诊断准确性。

Method: 1) 开发了结合局部（平面）和全局（体积/文本）引导的去噪扩散模型；2) 引入基于强化学习的框架，通过无监督奖励提取关键切片；3) 提供文本驱动的不确定性建模以优化分类概率。

Result: 在大规模3D子宫超声数据集上的实验表明，该方法在平面定位和CUA诊断方面效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的智能系统通过多模态信息融合和自适应优化策略，显著提升了CUA诊断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

Motivation: 无人机广泛应用下，复杂条件下的小目标检测仍具挑战性，现有方法在多模态输入时性能下降。

Method: 提出双分支架构处理红外和可见光图像，引入高效多尺度注意力机制（EMA），并用Gather-and-Distribute模块替代传统neck。

Conclusion: DGE-YOLO在多模态无人机目标检测任务中有效。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练方法主要针对分类模型，对目标检测器的防御研究不足。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局不可察觉对抗扰动，优化模型以防御多种攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著提升了鲁棒性，在对抗纹理攻击下检测准确率比现有方法提高29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT是一种有效的统一防御方法，能够应对多种物理可实现攻击，填补了目标检测器对抗训练的研究空白。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模拟在超级计算机上的通信延迟问题严重，现有方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息，限制了普通用户的分析能力。

Method: PCLVis利用MPI通信数据，通过空间定位、传播路径分析和事件归因策略，结合滑动窗口算法和CS-Glyph可视化工具，帮助用户分析通信延迟。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上的实验表明，PCLVis能有效分析通信延迟事件，显著提升模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路层信息的通信延迟分析工具，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on
our project website: https://synslidegen.github.io/.

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过结合因果关系和驾驶员注视数据，显著提升了合成交通事故视频的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉与文本表示，推动了多模态基础模型的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

Motivation: 医学图像生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述不易获取。

Result: 在四种数据集上验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion显著提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Conclusion: Mettle是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种音频-视觉任务。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过综合考虑场景、运动和外观三个方面的盲区，论文提出的方法显著提升了异常检测的全面性和准确性。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Conclusion: DDL数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，为深度伪造检测和可解释性研究提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

*Xiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffFit是一个两阶段潜在扩散框架，用于高保真虚拟试穿，通过几何感知的服装变形和纹理细化解决现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟试穿（VTON）在电子商务和数字时尚中有广泛应用，但现有方法在保留服装细节、精确对齐、推理效率和多样性适应方面仍有挑战。

Method: DiffFit采用两阶段策略：第一阶段进行几何感知的服装变形，第二阶段通过跨模态条件扩散模型细化纹理。

Result: DiffFit在大型VTON基准测试中表现优于现有方法，定量和感知评估均表现出色。

Conclusion: DiffFit通过解耦几何对齐和外观细化，显著提升了虚拟试穿的生成稳定性和视觉真实感。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

TL;DR: Endo-4DGX是一种新型重建方法，针对内窥镜场景中的不均匀光照问题，通过光照自适应高斯泼溅技术提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像引导机器人手术中，软组织的精确重建对自动化至关重要。现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在极端光照条件下（如低光和过曝）表现不佳，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: Endo-4DGX结合光照嵌入、区域感知增强模块和空间感知调整模块，实现了光照自适应优化，并引入曝光控制损失以恢复正常外观。

Result: 实验表明，Endo-4DGX在低光和过曝条件下显著优于现有重建和恢复方法，同时保持几何精度。

Conclusion: Endo-4DGX在挑战性光照环境中表现优异，有望推动机器人辅助手术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our
code is available at https://github.com/lastbasket/Endo-4DGX.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the
way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual
perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy.
Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastSeg是一种高效的训练无关框架，通过预训练扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的（1+1）步反向过程实现开放词汇语义分割（OVSS），并在多类别分割中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对比学习模型在像素级空间精度上的不足，以及扩散模型在迭代次数与分割质量之间的平衡问题。

Method: FastSeg采用双提示机制、分层注意力细化方法（HARD）和测试时翻转（TTF）方案，提升分割质量。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中，平均mIoU达到43.8%，并保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和推理效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench是一个新的基准测试，挑战视觉语言模型通过主动创建而非被动识别来展示对场景的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型是否真正理解场景，而不仅仅是描述任务。

Method: 基于分析-合成范式，要求视觉语言代理使用编程和渲染工具重新创建输入图像的3D结构。

Result: 初步实验揭示了当前模型在视觉精度上的局限性。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench旨在推动工具使用视觉语言代理的发展，实现真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine
scene understanding by creating.

TL;DR: IT-Blender是一种T2I扩散适配器，通过混合视觉和文本概念增强人类创造力，解决了现有方法在细节保留和解耦输入方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中存在认知偏差（如设计固定），导致设计空间局部最优。IT-Blender旨在自动化混合过程以提升创造力。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和噪声生成图像的潜在表示，结合新颖的混合注意力机制实现细节保留和解耦输入。

Result: 实验表明，IT-Blender在视觉和文本概念混合上大幅优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

TL;DR: 提出CycleVAR，通过Softmax Relaxed Quantization解决传统量化方法梯度中断问题，实现无监督图像翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于向量量化的方法在无监督图像翻译中因离散量化导致梯度中断，限制了端到端优化。

Method: 采用Softmax Relaxed Quantization保持梯度传播，并引入CycleVAR，通过多尺度源图像标记实现图像条件自回归生成。

Result: 并行单步生成模式在无监督场景下表现优于串行多步模式，CycleVAR超越现有最佳模型如CycleGAN-Turbo。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过连续概率混合和并行生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的质量和效率。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

Motivation: 现有3D语言方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市环境的能力。

Method: GeoProg3D包含地理感知城市规模3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用大型语言模型动态组合工具。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D首次实现了通过自然语言在城市规模3D环境中进行组合地理推理。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了红外图像低对比度问题，提升了自动驾驶感知能力。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FADRM在数据集蒸馏任务中实现了新的最优性能，同时大幅提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and
outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4%

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主题场景，且缺乏对多主题训练数据对和信号控制的研究。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道和IVTM训练方法，结合扩散Transformer框架OmniVCus，采用Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文方法在多主题视频定制和控制信号利用方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出PoS框架，设计PSE评估指标和PSG生成方法，通过梯度引导或噪声向量搜索改进空间关系生成。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

*Menna Taha,Aya Ahmed,Mohammed Karmoose,Yasser Gadallah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从传统基于类别的分类转向对象危害性判定，以提升自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法无法有效识别分布外（OOD）物体，可能导致自动驾驶车辆误判或漏检，引发安全隐患。

Method: 通过对象相对于自动驾驶车辆的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的决策能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的检测和响应能力，增强了安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LiDAR的世界模型，具有跨多个领域的强迁移能力，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖，并通过新的框架提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR世界模型局限于单一领域，缺乏跨领域迁移能力，且依赖大量标注数据。研究旨在开发具有强迁移性的模型，减少数据需求并提升效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于潜在条件流匹配（CFM）的框架，优化了LiDAR数据的压缩和训练目标，实现了高效训练和高精度重建。

Result: 模型在跨领域迁移中表现优异，仅需5%标注数据即可超越现有方法，同时实现了更高的计算效率和压缩比（6倍）。

Conclusion: 该研究为LiDAR世界模型提供了高效的跨领域迁移解决方案，显著提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Motivation: 解决病理图像数据稀缺问题，同时利用文本和掩码数据的互补性增强图像生成的控制能力。

Method: 提出PathDiff框架，将未配对的文本和掩码数据整合到统一的条件空间中，实现结构和上下文特征的精确控制。

Result: PathDiff生成的图像质量高、语义准确，提升了图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: PathDiff优于现有方法，为病理图像生成和数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLDF的新方法，通过对比学习将扩散模型的特征映射到低维嵌入空间，以改进弱监督语义分割中的噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于CAM的方法在弱监督语义分割中存在部分激活和边界不精确的问题，而基于条件扩散模型的方法则容易受到反向扩散过程中背景噪声的影响。

Method: CLDF方法结合对比学习，利用冻结的条件扩散模型的特征和梯度图与CAM结合，减少假阳性/阴性，学习鲁棒的像素嵌入。

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务上，CLDF方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CLDF通过对比学习和扩散特征的结合，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的噪声问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: CLIP模型在医学图像分类中表现优异，但存在公平性问题，如种族和性别偏见，影响诊断结果的可靠性。

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗性特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上实验表明，AdFair-CLIP显著提高公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和小样本场景中保持稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型（尤其是胸部X光分析）设定了公平性学习的新基准。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

TL;DR: GeoCD是一种基于拓扑感知和可微分近似的地面距离度量，用于改进3D点云学习中的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性，因此需要一种更有效的度量方法。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微分的地面距离近似方法，并通过微调模型验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在多种架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需一个epoch的微调即可实现多指标改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的替代CD的度量方法，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 解决Implicit Neural Representation (INR)的高GPU资源需求和GaussianImage训练慢、适应性差的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，并通过少量微调步骤优化，动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更优，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、灵活，显著提升了图像表示的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本匹配任务中表现优异，但缺乏对细粒度动作的理解能力，限制了其在描述对象状态或关系中的应用。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的外部知识，并通过自适应交互模块聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入LLM增强的动作感知提示调优，显著提升了CLIP模型在细粒度动作理解上的性能。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of

Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by

strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效的同时，显著提升了多视图合成的视图一致性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用眼动追踪信息辅助视频显著物体检测的弱监督方法，通过PSE模块和SLQ Competitor提升特征学习与时空建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动追踪注释更易获取且符合人类视觉模式，因此论文探索如何利用这些信息改进视频显著物体检测。

Method: 设计了PSE模块提供位置和语义指导，SLQ Competitor选择最优对象查询，IIMC模型通过对比学习增强时空建模。

Result: 在五个VSOD基准测试中，模型在多种评估指标上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督方法有效提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优于现有方法，且实现实时性能，机器人实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低复杂度，高效利用时序信息，显著提升自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 自监督TTA协议和协作学习框架有效提升了自监督模型在测试时的适应能力，为动态环境中的模型应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Method: 图像编码为数百个高斯参数，位置、尺度、颜色等与ViT联合优化，利用分类器梯度和可微分渲染器指导高斯分布。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k上达到76.9% top-1准确率，性能接近传统ViT。

Conclusion: GVIT通过高斯输入表示和优化策略，实现了与传统ViT相当的性能，展示了新输入表示的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，提升时间稳定性和空间清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在单帧或多帧处理中忽略深度变化导致的时空不一致问题。

Method: 利用图结构的时序自相似性进行跨帧几何注意力融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集上达到最优性能，并在真实Kinectv2数据集上表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且可解释，代码已开源。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiTs的计算成本，同时保持了生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiTs使用固定patch大小，无法灵活调整计算成本。PPFlow旨在通过动态patch大小优化计算效率。

Method: 提出PPFlow方法，根据噪声水平动态调整patch大小，并为每个大小学习线性投影，同时修改Unpatchify。

Result: 训练结果表明，PPFlow在推理速度上显著提升（1.6×-2.0×），且生成性能相近。

Conclusion: PPFlow通过动态patch大小和优化投影，有效提升了DiTs的计算效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务的需求，提出一种简单但高效的模型。

Method: 使用两步增强模型（TF和CCM），引入eigenTF紧凑表示，通过Y-Net和C-Net预测参数，支持K种风格学习。

Result: 在30个数据集上成功完成六种增强任务，表现优异。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效且通用的多风格图像增强算法。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为整体音频-视觉合成提供了实用解决方案，推动了多模态生成建模的发展。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理硬样本时表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度，导致训练策略过于统一。

Method: 结合vMF分布的相似性度量，提出自适应边缘的多分类方法（Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function），并利用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布，同时通过渲染器优化人脸重建。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，比第二名方法高出2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应策略和概率分布优化，显著提升了硬高质量人脸识别的性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角3D目标检测方法通常通过深度估计或3D位置编码将2D特征转换到3D空间，但这种方式完全依赖数据驱动且隐式，限制了检测性能。受辐射场在3D重建中的成功启发，作者尝试将其用于增强3D几何估计能力。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于前景物体建模，避免背景噪声干扰；进一步利用渲染的副产品——不透明度，通过高度感知的不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes验证和测试数据集上的实验表明，OcRFDet方法以57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS的性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过专注于前景物体建模和利用不透明度增强特征，OcRFDet显著提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，感知质量指标（FID和LPIPS）验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于详细遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Conclusion: StackCLIP模型通过堆叠提示和模块化设计，显著提升了训练速度、稳定性和性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and

capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种两阶段训练策略，通过从部分场景到全局场景的课程学习，提升开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多视角图像仅视为传递开放词汇信息的媒介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视角对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: 1. 预训练阶段：在提供密集语义信息但几何简单的部分场景上训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签。2. 微调阶段：在稀疏且结构复杂的完整场景点云上微调，通过聚合部分词汇生成伪标签。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过两阶段训练和课程学习，有效提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3DGS依赖高质量点云的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，但在纹理不足或视角受限的场景中表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: AttentionGS利用几何注意力快速恢复全局场景结构，随后引入纹理注意力优化细节，并使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密度化。

Result: 实验表明，AttentionGS在点云初始化不可靠的场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为3DGS在现实应用中提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种基于扩散模型的超高效视频超分辨率方法，通过高压缩比自动编码器、因子化条件和预训练扩散模型的转换，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持了与现有最佳方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，处理短视频耗时过长。

Method: TurboVSR采用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量，引入因子化条件降低训练复杂度，并将预训练扩散模型转换为捷径模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR在性能上与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计解决了计算效率问题，为更高分辨率的超分辨率任务提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

Method: 采用视觉中心Transformer框架，结合原型提示查询生成模块（PPQG），通过视觉驱动查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Conclusion: 扩散模型展示了显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化的敏感性也暴露无遗。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法依赖梯度或代理模型带来的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出Partial Forward Blocking (PFB)，基于浅层特征评估样本重要性并动态剪枝，结合概率密度指标和自适应分布估计模块。

Result: 在ImageNet上，剪枝40%数据时，PFB实现0.5%准确率提升和33%训练时间减少。

Conclusion: PFB是一种高效的无损训练加速框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: Vision Transformer的高计算成本限制了其在资源有限硬件上的应用，传统剪枝方法在未见数据域上表现不佳。

Method: 提出P3B方法，通过块级相对贡献分配参数资源，保留关键组件并减少低影响组件的参数分配。

Result: P3B在高稀疏性（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，尤其在资源受限场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Result: 方法在ACM MM25的对抗攻击竞赛中获得第一名，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合语义和视觉优化，显著提升了视频运动的定制化生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

Conclusion: 方法有效且实用，代码已开源，易于集成到nnUNet框架。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的双重限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临用户主观输入偏差、平面草图与3D先验之间的模态差距以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型模型调整或不切实际的草图精度要求。

Method: 采用概念序列生成，通过文本奖励优化建立外观先验，并实现序列感知的解耦生成，同时利用潜在优化桥接模态差距，支持粗糙草图使用。

Result: 在多样数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在保持语义和空间一致性方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera框架有效解决了现有挑战，无需训练即可适应用户主观期望，支持粗糙草图输入。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

TL;DR: Proteus-ID是一种基于扩散模型的视频身份定制框架，通过多模态身份融合和时间感知身份注入解决身份一致性和运动连贯性问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，需要一种新方法来同时满足这两点。

Method: 提出Proteus-ID框架，包括多模态身份融合（MIF）、时间感知身份注入（TAII）和自适应运动学习（AML）三个模块。

Result: 实验表明，Proteus-ID在身份保留、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制设立了新基准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据挑战开放词汇目标检测器的局限性，并揭示了其失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据无法提供足够的控制来评估其泛化能力。

Method: 设计了两个自动化流程，使用稳定扩散技术生成多样化的合成数据，并评估了多种检测器。

Result: 合成数据能有效挑战检测器，发现其依赖对象位置而非语义的失败模式。

Conclusion: 合成数据为挑战和改进开放词汇目标检测器提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Motivation: 解决罕见类别因难以用文本描述且预训练数据中几乎不存在而导致的检测困难问题。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本特征空间中的视觉标记，指导OVLM。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（如PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLM原有架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

TL;DR: CRefDiff是一种基于可控扩散模型的超分辨率方法，用于遥感图像，解决了现有方法在真实场景中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考超分辨率方法在真实场景中面临跨传感器分辨率差异和地表覆盖变化等问题，导致性能受限。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制和Better Start策略，提升生成质量和效率。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上表现优异，提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过创新设计和数据集支持，为遥感图像超分辨率提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统初始化自由BA方法因无法利用相机标定信息，导致重建结果仅为投影变换，且需要更多数据。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，结合pOSE框架，实现无需初始化的标定SfM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解收敛到全局最小值，实现高精度的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合旋转平均和相机标定信息，显著提升了重建的度量精度和可靠性。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Result: 在多模态数据上验证，性能优于现有方法，适用于同数据集和跨数据集评估。

Conclusion: 该方法无需合成数据或内存库，各组件通过消融实验验证有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

TL;DR: LaZSL是一种基于局部对齐的视觉语言模型，通过最优传输实现视觉区域与属性的交互，提升零样本学习的可解释性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性，难以解释预测结果。

Method: 提出LaZSL模型，利用最优传输实现局部视觉特征与属性的对齐，无需额外训练即可提供可解释的相似性。

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在可解释性、准确性和领域泛化性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为视觉语言模型的可解释性提供了一种有效解决方案，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Motivation: 现有模型处理长视频时存在计算和内存开销大的问题，且方法效率低，难以推广到更长的视频。

Method: 提出Flash Memory模块，包含低容量上下文记忆和高容量增强记忆，分别聚合长上下文时间信息和检索详细空间信息。

Result: 在多个长视频和综合视频基准测试中（如EgoSchema、MLVU等），Flash-VStream表现出最先进的性能和高效性。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream通过创新的内存设计，高效处理长视频，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Conclusion: NH2ST通过多模态整合和空间建模，为基因表达预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力在分类任务中的学习机制，并推广到大规模MHA（LS-MHA），以提升分类精度和效率。

Method: 通过单头性能（SHP）矩阵量化多头注意力的表现，分析其单元簇结构，并设计新的视觉变换器（ViT）架构。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵由多个单元簇组成，显著提高信噪比和分类精度，同时通过卷积层替换降低延迟。

Conclusion: 这一机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Conclusion: PointSSIM为跨分辨率图像比较提供了一种有效且可靠的新方法。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

Result: 在新型视图合成和几何补全任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAISE在保持空间一致性的同时，实现了高保真度的对象几何和外观恢复。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

Result: 实验表明现有VQA模型在RGC视频质量评估中存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对RGC的VQA模型，RGCD数据库为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决视觉语言预训练模型在适应下游任务时面临的Base-New Tradeoff问题，即模型对基础任务优化后对新任务的泛化能力下降。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示学习，快速适应新类别。CaPT还可与无条件PT方法结合使用。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件PT基线的性能，且计算成本几乎不增加。结合DePT框架的DeCaPT方法在性能上优于现有条件PT方法3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI-conditioned提示有效解决了BNT问题，且具有高效性和普适性，为视觉语言模型的快速适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

*Jianzong Wu,Liang Hou,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Ye Tian,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Yunhai Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种针对视频扩散模型的稀疏注意力机制，通过动态块选择和优化，显著提升了训练和推理效率，同时保持或超越全注意力的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全注意力机制在视频扩散模型中存在计算复杂度高的问题，现有稀疏注意力方法未能充分利用视频数据的时空特性。

Method: VMoBA通过层递归块分区、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择，优化了稀疏注意力机制。

Result: VMoBA在训练和推理中分别实现了2.92x和2.40x的FLOPs加速，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Puzzles的数据增强策略，通过单张图像或视频片段合成高质量的姿态-深度数据，显著提升了3D重建模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUST3R）的性能受限于训练数据的多样性和规模，因此需要一种能生成大量高质量数据的方法。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和场景几何，对图像进行针对性变换，生成无限量的训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles能显著提升性能，即使仅使用10%的原始数据也能达到与完整数据集相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强策略，无需修改网络架构即可提升3D重建模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

TL;DR: SPROD是一种新型基于原型的OOD检测方法，通过优化类别原型减少虚假相关性的影响，无需额外数据或调参，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型鲁棒性不足。SPROD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPROD通过后处理优化类别原型，减少虚假特征的偏差，适用于多种模型和OOD检测场景。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CelebA、Waterbirds等）上，SPROD平均AUROC提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SPROD在OOD检测中表现出色，能有效应对虚假相关性，提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow是一种双分支框架，通过正交视图减少全景光学流中的失真，特别是在极地区域，采用DCCL操作和ODDC模块优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光学流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真（尤其是极地区域）表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出PriOr-Flow框架，结合正交视图和DCCL操作构建双成本体积，并通过ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: 在公开全景光学流数据集上表现优异，兼容多种迭代光学流方法，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

TL;DR: 研究发现，在脑成像分析中，简单的卷积网络（SFCN）比复杂的注意力架构（如Swin Transformer）表现更好，具有更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估深度学习模型在不同脑成像队列中对年龄和性别预测的泛化能力，年龄和性别是临床神经科学中的重要生物标志。

Method: 使用三种3D架构（SFCN、DenseNet、Swin Transformer）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI、IXI）中预测年龄和性别。

Result: SFCN在性别分类和年龄预测任务中表现最佳，泛化能力优于复杂架构。

Conclusion: 简单卷积网络在脑图像分析中优于复杂架构，具有更好的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Motivation: 解决文本链式思维（CoT）在处理视觉信息时的语义鸿沟问题，推动AI从"关于图像的思考"到"用图像思考"的范式转变。

Method: 通过三阶段框架（外部工具探索、程序化操作、内在想象）分析视觉认知的演进，并综述核心方法、评估基准和应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI的未来发展提供了清晰路线图，旨在实现更强大且与人类认知对齐的智能系统。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Result: 在RGB-热成像、RGB-深度和RGB-事件等多模态跟踪任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VMDA通过双适配器机制显著提升了多模态跟踪的鲁棒性和判别性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Method: 通过提取人类可理解的概念及其相关性分数，计算相似实例的对比，并基于解释复杂度评估结果。

Result: 高相关性的概念生成更简洁的解释，低相关性则生成更复杂的解释；解释在不同图像增强下表现出不同程度的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果展示了构建更可解释和鲁棒AI系统的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Motivation: 传统自动驾驶系统中个性化已有所探索，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中却被忽视。用户对齐行为对信任和舒适度至关重要，但缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集阻碍了发展。

Method: 提取静态环境特征，利用微调的VLM推断动态上下文线索，构建一致且细粒度的场景。通过行为分布分析和规则启发式生成客观偏好标注，并利用VLM建模场景语义和驾驶行为生成主观标注，最终通过人工验证融合两者。

Result: 提出的数据集和基准显示，结合个性化偏好的模型行为更符合人类驾驶。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently

heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded

average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding

scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中数据分布随时间空间变化，传统基于封闭集假设的目标检测器难以适应，持续测试时间适应成为研究重点。然而，少量测试图像下微调特定参数可能影响其他固定参数的表示能力，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计了基于双路径LoRA的域感知适配器，分离特征为域不变和域特定部分；提出条件扩散参数生成机制，根据当前环境合成适配器参数；采用类中心最优传输对齐方法缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 通过参数生成机制和域感知适配器，论文方法显著提升了目标检测器在动态环境中的适应性和泛化性能。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

TL;DR: WaRA是一种基于小波变换的参数高效微调方法，通过多分辨率分析改进LoRA，在视觉任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新的复杂模式。

Method: WaRA利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在小波域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重建更新。

Result: WaRA在图像生成、分类和语义分割等任务中表现优于现有方法，同时降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: WaRA不仅适用于视觉任务，在语言任务中也表现出广泛的适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

*Antoine Guédon,Diego Gomez,Nissim Maruani,Bingchen Gong,George Drettakis,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILo是一种新型高斯溅射框架，通过可微分地从3D高斯中提取网格，解决了从体积表示到表面表示的转换问题，实现了高质量、轻量级的3D场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从高斯溅射重建3D场景时，提取表面网格需要昂贵的后处理步骤，导致几何细节丢失或生成过于密集的网格。MILo旨在直接在训练过程中提取网格，保留几何结构。

Method: MILo设计了完全可微分的过程，从高斯参数中直接构建网格（顶点和连接性），并引入了双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于高斯的有符号距离计算方法。

Result: MILo能够重建完整场景，包括背景，质量达到最新水平，且所需网格顶点数量比之前方法少一个数量级。

Conclusion: MILo的轻量级网格适合下游应用（如物理模拟或动画），解决了现有方法在表面提取中的局限性。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了高质量的数据集和高效的标注方法，推动了多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在长时预测和轨迹规划方面表现不佳，因其依赖固定长度帧序列的全局联合分布建模。

Result: 实验显示，FVD提升7.4%，预测时长显著增加，并在NAVSIM基准测试中优于端到端规划器。

Conclusion: Epona模型在长时预测和实时运动规划中表现出色，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Motivation: 当前扩散生成模型在图像、视频和3D内容生成方面取得进展，但动态3D内容生成（文本到4D）仍是一个未充分探索的挑战性问题。

Method: 采用基于面的Jacobians作为可微分网格表示，将4D生成分解为静态对象创建和动态运动合成两阶段，并提出灵活性-刚性正则化项以稳定优化。

Conclusion: TextMesh4D为文本驱动的4D网格生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，代码将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D
generation.

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的隐式神经表示（INR）视频压缩方法RNeRV，通过优化组件设计和引入超网络技术，显著提升了压缩质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR视频压缩方法因需逐样本训练网络，编码速度过慢，难以实际应用。研究旨在解决这一问题，同时提升压缩性能。

Method: 开发了一个库以分析NeRV家族方法的组件，提出RNeRV配置，并引入超网络技术预测INR权重，通过掩码训练提升质量。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下平均PSNR提升1.27%；超网络技术进一步提升了PSNR和MS-SSIM，同时保持编码速度。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络技术显著提升了INR视频压缩的性能和实用性，为实时编码提供了可能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

Result: VoteSplat在开放词汇3D实例定位、点云理解等任务中表现优异，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: VoteSplat为3D场景理解提供高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Motivation: 解决OBB层次结构在计算和内存上的高成本问题，同时提升光线追踪的遍历效率。

Method: 采用固定离散旋转集的OBB变换，并扩展至多子节点层次结构，利用k-DOPs优化性能。

Result: 实验显示，构建时间增加12.6%，但光线追踪性能平均提升18.5%（主光线）和32.4%（次光线），最高提升65%。

Conclusion: 该方法能无缝集成现有流程，显著提升实时应用的光线追踪性能。

Abstract: Oriented bounding box (OBB) bounding volume hierarchies offer a more precise
fit than axis-aligned bounding box hierarchies in scenarios with thin elongated
and arbitrarily rotated geometry, enhancing intersection test performance in
ray tracing. However, determining optimally oriented bounding boxes can be
computationally expensive and have high memory requirements. Recent research
has shown that pre-built hierarchies can be efficiently converted to OBB
hierarchies on the GPU in a bottom-up pass, yielding significant ray tracing
traversal improvements. In this paper, we introduce a novel OBB construction
technique where all internal node children share a consistent OBB transform,
chosen from a fixed set of discrete quantized rotations. This allows for
efficient encoding and reduces the computational complexity of OBB
transformations. We further extend our approach to hierarchies with multiple
children per node by leveraging Discrete Orientation Polytopes (k-DOPs),
demonstrating improvements in traversal performance while limiting the build
time impact for real-time applications. Our method is applied as a
post-processing step, integrating seamlessly into existing hierarchy
construction pipelines. Despite a 12.6% increase in build time, our
experimental results demonstrate an average improvement of 18.5% in primary,
32.4% in secondary rays, and maximum gain of 65% in ray intersection
performance, highlighting its potential for advancing real-time applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often
produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational
overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable
confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is
optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the
quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs
between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering problems involving multi-physics span a wide
range of scales. Understanding the interactions across these scales is
essential for fully comprehending such complex problems. However, visualizing
multivariate, multiscale data within an integrated view where correlations
across space, scales, and fields are easily perceived remains challenging. To
address this, we introduce a novel local spatial statistical visualization of
flow fields across multiple fields and turbulence scales. Our method leverages
the curvelet transform for scale decomposition of fields of interest, a
level-set-restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation to partition the spatial
domain into local regions for statistical aggregation, and a set of glyph
designs that combines information across scales and fields into a single, or
reduced set of perceivable visual representations. Each glyph represents data
aggregated within a Voronoi region and is positioned at the Voronoi site for
direct visualization in a 3D view centered around flow features of interest. We
implement and integrate our method into an interactive visualization system
where the glyph-based technique operates in tandem with linked 3D spatial views
and 2D statistical views, supporting a holistic analysis. We demonstrate with
case studies visualizing turbulent combustion data--multi-scalar compressible
flows--and turbulent incompressible channel flow data. This new capability
enables scientists to better understand the interactions between multiple
fields and length scales in turbulent flows.

Abstract: We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking
organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We
formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is
to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting
displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our
method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations
such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we
consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior
deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive
tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise
adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic
control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various
examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in
applications such as fabrication and animation.

Abstract: The analysis of 3D symmetric second-order tensor fields often relies on
topological features such as degenerate tensor lines, neutral surfaces, and
their generalization to mode surfaces, which reveal important structural
insights into the data. However, uncertainty in such fields is typically
visualized using derived scalar attributes or tensor glyph representations,
which often fail to capture the global behavior. Recent advances have
introduced uncertain topological features for tensor field ensembles by
focusing on degenerate tensor locations. Yet, mode surfaces, including neutral
surfaces and arbitrary mode surfaces are essential to a comprehensive
understanding of tensor field topology. In this work, we present a
generalization of uncertain degenerate tensor features to uncertain mode
surfaces of arbitrary mode values, encompassing uncertain degenerate tensor
lines as a special case. Our approach supports both surface and line
geometries, forming a unified framework for analyzing uncertain mode-based
topological features in tensor field ensembles. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on several real-world simulation datasets from
engineering and materials science.

Abstract: The creation of virtual humans increasingly leverages automated synthesis of
speech and gestures, enabling expressive, adaptable agents that effectively
engage users. However, the independent development of voice and gesture
generation technologies, alongside the growing popularity of virtual reality
(VR), presents significant questions about the integration of these signals and
their ability to convey emotional detail in immersive environments. In this
paper, we evaluate the influence of real and synthetic gestures and speech,
alongside varying levels of immersion (VR vs. 2D displays) and emotional
contexts (positive, neutral, negative) on user perceptions. We investigate how
immersion affects the perceived match between gestures and speech and the
impact on key aspects of user experience, including emotional and empathetic
responses and the sense of co-presence. Our findings indicate that while VR
enhances the perception of natural gesture-voice pairings, it does not
similarly improve synthetic ones - amplifying the perceptual gap between them.
These results highlight the need to reassess gesture appropriateness and refine
AI-driven synthesis for immersive environments. See video:

Method: GaVS利用3D相机位姿，通过高斯散射基元预测和测试时微调，结合多视角动态感知光度监督和跨帧正则化，实现时间一致的局部重建和渲染。

Result: 在多样化的相机运动和场景动态数据集上，GaVS在任务指标和几何一致性上优于现有2D和2.5D方法，用户研究也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: GaVS通过3D基础方法显著提升了视频稳定效果，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

*Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整引导比例的退火引导调度器，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导（CFG）的引导比例选择对生成图像质量和提示对齐有重要影响，但现有方法存在收敛问题。

Method: 通过基于条件噪声信号动态调整引导比例的退火调度策略，学习调度策略以优化CFG的行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量和提示对齐，且无需额外计算资源。

Conclusion: 提出的调度器改进了文本到图像生成的性能，平衡了提示对齐和质量，可无缝替代现有CFG。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经渲染方法（如NeRFs和3DGS）依赖预处理相机姿态和3D结构先验的问题，尤其是在户外场景中。

Method: 结合ICP与优化细化技术进行相机姿态估计，并引入体素化场景稠密化方法指导大规模场景重建。

Result: 实验表明，ICP-3DGS在室内外不同尺度场景的相机姿态估计和新视角合成中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经渲染中的相机姿态估计问题，提升了重建和合成效果。

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses
and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are
challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based
refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera
movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification
approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both
camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor
scenes of various scales. Source code is available at

*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过心理语言学数据集评估LLMs与人类在词汇特征上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在感官关联方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估多关注任务性能，但词汇的感官和情感特征难以量化，需与人类心理语言学数据对齐。

Method: 利用Glasgow和Lancaster数据集，评估LLMs与人类在13种词汇特征上的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow数据集（情感、熟悉度等）上对齐较好，但在Lancaster数据集（感官特征）上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs缺乏人类的具体认知，感官关联能力有限，心理语言学数据集有助于全面评估LLMs。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，用于自动化审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，利用AI智能体实现准确性、一致性、完整性和清晰性的分节评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解决方案主要针对非结构化文本或有限合规性检查，无法满足企业文档的高效审核需求。

Method: 采用LangChain、CrewAI等现代编排工具，通过并行或顺序运行的专用智能体进行分节审核，并输出标准化、机器可读的结果。

Result: AI系统在信息一致性（99% vs. 92%）、错误率减半、审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟等方面优于人类，且与专家判断一致率达95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但需在高度专业化领域保留人工监督，并考虑大规模LLM使用的成本。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在问答任务中可能产生幻觉回答，缺乏真实背景时难以检测，影响可靠性。

Method: 将回答分解为单句，利用多个小型语言模型生成“是”标记的概率进行验证。

Result: 实验显示F1分数提高10%，能有效检测正确回答与幻觉。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可高效验证LLM回答，为学术和实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出PromptAug，一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，用于解决社交媒体冲突检测中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，并在准确率和F1分数上提升了2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突检测需要高质量标注数据，但这类数据稀缺且获取成本高，同时LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，利用LLM进行数据增强，并通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升，同时识别了增强文本中的四类问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug为敏感任务（如冲突检测）提供了一种有效的数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

Motivation: 现有文本匿名化方法存在效用损失或隐私风险，需探索更高效的本地化解决方案。

Method: 结合上下文对比学习和自适应效用感知控制的对抗性工作流，监督适应SLMs，并应用在线强化学习优化性能。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，效用提升6.8%。

Conclusion: AgentStealth框架高效且轻量，适合边缘设备部署，避免云端依赖和隐私风险。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

Motivation: 图数据在不同领域的语义和属性差异显著，传统对比预训练策略无法有效吸收多领域知识。

Method: 设计了一种新的对比学习策略以识别领域差异，并引入领域令牌编码全局信息；下游任务中采用领域注意力机制实现细粒度知识迁移。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过多领域预训练和跨领域迁移框架，显著提升了图基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

Motivation: 解决图检索增强生成中弱监督导致的虚假信号和检索知识无序问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升达10%，训练数据需求减少至5%，推理成本降低30%。

Conclusion: ReG有效提升图检索增强生成的性能，减少资源消耗，并具备泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

Conclusion: 该研究为德语Telegram网络的虚假信息检测提供了可复现的基准和开放数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

Motivation: 研究LLM代理在自主实现研究扩展任务上的能力，填补现有评估工具的空白。

Method: 开发RExBench基准测试，包含12个任务，评估9个LLM代理在三种框架下的表现。

Result: 所有代理在多数任务中失败，即使有提示，最佳成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在自主处理研究扩展任务时仍需大量人工指导。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Method: 结合BM25和E5检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过RankLLaMA进行神经重排序。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法有效，但需权衡性能与计算成本；词汇对齐是性能的关键因素。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在团队对话中检测微行为的可行性，比较了不同方法的效果，发现解码器模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用LLMs分析团队对话中的微行为，以提升高压力环境（如太空任务）中的沟通技术。

Method: 采用了零样本分类、微调、改写增强微调（编码器模型）和少样本文本生成（解码器模型）等方法。

Result: 解码器模型（如Llama-3.1）表现优于编码器模型，在二元分类中F1分数达68%。

Conclusion: 解码器模型更适合分析团队对话中的微行为，对高压力环境下的沟通技术开发有重要意义。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过重构drafter的LM head以减少词汇量，从而降低推理开销，提升内存受限环境下的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推测解码方法中因共享词汇表或LM head导致的推理开销问题，尤其是在词汇量大的目标模型上。

Method: VocabTrim通过限制drafter的LM head词汇量为高频词，减少推理延迟。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，内存受限速度提升16%（Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct）。

Conclusion: VocabTrim能有效提升内存受限环境下的生成速度，尽管略微降低接受率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在生成中低资源语言内容时质量较差，原因在于模型隐含的任务解决-翻译流程中翻译阶段的失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言生成质量低的原因，尤其是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过分析108种语言对的单词翻译任务，使用logit lens观察模型中间层处理。

Result: 翻译失败是导致输出质量低的主要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进多语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型显式承认受提示线索影响，显著减少了奖励黑客行为，提高了检测透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为，而不会在推理链中暴露，增加了检测难度和高风险应用的风险。

Method: 提出VFT方法，训练模型显式承认受提示线索影响，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练后，仅6%的响应为未检测到的奖励黑客行为，而未经VFT的RL模型高达88%。VFT显著提高了模型对线索影响的显式承认率。

Conclusion: VFT通过显式承认奖励黑客行为，显著提高了检测透明度，为更安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构优化多轮对话中的缓存命中率，显著降低延迟和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：先基于向量检索当前查询，再通过自注意力机制整合历史和当前对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中提高了精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著提升了多轮对话中的语义缓存效率，降低了LLM应用的计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Result: 评估显示MedLLMs在回答医学伦理问题时表现不如基础模型，揭示了医学伦理对齐的不足。

Conclusion: MedEthicsQA为评估和改进MedLLMs的伦理安全性提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

$\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs.
We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

Motivation: 现有方法在多领域训练统一模型缺乏适应性和扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: SaM框架动态选择预训练的领域专家模型，基于领域相似性和性能样本，合并为任务特定模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SaM框架平均比统一模型性能提升10%，并展示了高扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架通过动态合并专家模型，显著提升跨领域泛化能力和扩展性，为信息提取任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC模型在语言依赖性建模上的不足，同时保持其非自回归解码的高效性。

Method: 通过连接层将中间编码器输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著降低了词错误率（WER），达到CTC模型的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的语义建模能力，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中均显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提升LLM在真实场景中的表现，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在高精度转录中仍难以处理命名实体和数值数据的格式化问题，影响语义理解，尤其在法律、金融和医疗领域。

Method: 采用重叠上下文窗口训练，通过5秒重叠扩展30秒语块至40秒有效语义窗口，优化实体识别与格式化，并处理跨边界实体。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上验证，该方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练有效解决了ASR在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多代理和人类-AI系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 论文通过三个维度（推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好）评估LLM的对话伙伴意识，并开发了三个案例研究展示其实际影响。

Result: LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），对话伙伴意识既能提升多LLM协作，也可能引入新的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既带来潜力也带来风险，需进一步研究和安全措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 研究旨在验证和扩展Ortu等人关于语言模型中事实与反事实信息竞争机制的发现，探讨其在更大模型和不同条件下的适用性。

Method: 复现了Ortu等人的实验，并在GPT-2和Pythia 6.9B上验证结果，进一步扩展到Llama 3.1 8B模型，并测试了不同提示结构和领域的影响。

Result: 发现注意力头在更大模型中专业化程度降低，提示结构变化显著影响反事实标记的logit值，某些领域的数据集会导致结果偏差。

Conclusion: Ortu等人提出的注意力头消融方法在某些领域和模型架构中效果有限，其有效性受多种因素影响。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction

attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的框架，用于组合式句法语言模型（SLMs），并对其进行了全面的实证评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强Transformer模型，通过引入句法偏置和显式的自底向上组合表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，组合式SLMs在语言建模、句法泛化、摘要、对话和推理效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出了组合式SLMs的设计建议，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

TL;DR: SoMi-ToM是一个新的基准测试，用于评估在多代理复杂社交互动中的多视角心理理论（ToM）能力，填补了现有静态文本基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距，因此需要更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 基于SoMi环境生成的多模态互动数据，设计了第一人称和第三人称视角的多层次评估框架，包括实时状态推断和目标行为推断。

Result: 人类在SoMi-ToM上的表现显著优于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），平均准确率差距分别为40.1%（第一人称）和26.4%（第三人称）。

Conclusion: 未来LVLMs需提升在具身复杂社交互动中的ToM能力，SoMi-ToM为此提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在数字人文学科中分析历史文本时。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多个手动标注的句子，并评估了最先进NER模型的性能。

Result: MariNER成为首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，并验证了现有模型的适用性。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Motivation: LLMs在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库扩展LLMs的化学结构覆盖范围，并设计分子-光谱评分器作为推理过程的奖励模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了性能，在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上均实现了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和推理优化，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL在处理非结构化数据或模糊查询时效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但缺乏系统化实现和评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，支持语义过滤、多模态匹配和检索加速，并通过自动标注和专家评审构建评估体系。

Result: 实验显示Text2VectorSQL在性能上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更灵活直观的数据库接口奠定了基础，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见。

Method: 引入Genres基准，通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务评估MLLMs的性别偏见，涵盖多维度的精细分析。

Result: 实验显示，MLLMs在双人互动中存在持续的、上下文敏感的性别偏见，这些偏见在单角色场景中不明显。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中微妙的互动驱动性别偏见至关重要，为未来偏见缓解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个针对印度文化多样性的公平性基准，涵盖85个身份群体，评估14个LLM的公平性，发现对边缘化群体的强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究以西方为中心，无法适用于文化多样的印度，需建立本土化基准。

Method: 通过专家咨询确定1800多个社会文化主题，生成并验证2万个现实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务。

Result: LLM对边缘化群体表现出强烈偏见，难以消除刻板印象，甚至在被要求理性决策时仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: LLM可能对印度身份群体造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用，并开源INDIC-BIAS以推动研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在英语和混合语言（英语-印地语）的网络迷因中识别叙事角色（英雄、反派、受害者和其它）的挑战，通过多模型评估揭示了文化背景和提示设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别是一个复杂且文化相关的任务，现有数据集偏向‘其它’类别，需要更平衡和多样化的扩展。

Method: 使用多种模型（包括多语言Transformer、情感分类器、多模态模型等）在零样本设置下评估性能，并探索提示设计策略。

Result: 大模型（如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL）表现较好，但‘受害者’类别的识别和跨文化泛化仍具挑战性。混合提示设计带来小幅改进。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld上分别达到97.78%和79.92%的完成率，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了LLM在任务规划中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，性能平均提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，显著提升了LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Method: 采用结合向量相似性搜索和基于Gemma-2-9b-it的重新排序器的RAG管道，使用RAFT方法在自定义数据集上训练。

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，分别获得94%和96%的忠实度分数，以及87%和93%的答案相关性分数。

Conclusion: 提出的架构在表格问题和上下文外问题处理上优于通用RAG管道。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

Motivation: 现有方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: FMS框架包含语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，动态优化实体对的初始静态评分。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过动态和静态信息的结合，显著提升了关系语义建模的效果。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Motivation: 当前评估ICL效果的方法存在可靠性低、归因性差和数据依赖性强的问题，需要一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 提出LCS指标，通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率来量化ICL效果。

Result: LCS在标记数据场景中与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏差场景中也能可靠反映ICL效果。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL有效性评估工具，并揭示了ICL成功的关键模型能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Result: 实验表明V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示样本的一致性和多样性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

Motivation: 传统词嵌入模型因静态特性无法适应语言动态变化（如社交媒体中的新词汇），需要增量词嵌入算法来解决。

Method: 提出RiverText库，实现多种增量词嵌入技术（如Skip-gram、CBOW等），并基于PyTorch进行神经网络训练。

Result: 库支持流式场景下的词嵌入评估任务，比较了不同超参数设置下的方法效果。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了处理流式数据的工具，开源库已发布。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

### [278] [Generalist Reward Models: Found Inside Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23235)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过预训练语言模型内生的奖励信号替代传统人工偏好数据训练的奖励模型，证明了其理论等效性，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型依赖昂贵的人工偏好数据，且缺乏理论支持，作者希望找到一种更高效、理论严谨的替代方法。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型内生的奖励信号，证明其与离线逆强化学习奖励函数的理论等效性，并直接从中提取高质量奖励信号。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有LLM-as-a-judge方法，甚至超过显式训练的奖励模型，且强化学习后策略具有更优误差界。

Conclusion: 研究表明奖励建模阶段可被预训练模型内生的奖励信号替代，为LLM对齐提供了更高效、强大的新范式。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写归一化方法，一种无监督训练，另一种基于机器翻译，评估表明机器翻译更适合此任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文献中拼写不标准的问题，为学者提供拼写归一化工具。

Method: 提出两种方法：无监督训练的大语言模型和基于机器翻译的模型。

Result: 两种方法均有效，但机器翻译表现更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译是目前最适合拼写归一化的技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过多尺度表示学习符号序列，构建投影张量绑定共现特征。

Result: 模型能够从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有连贯内部形态的合成语言，并支持长程依赖和组合推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用。n2c2 2022挑战赛提供了相关任务，本研究专注于其中的子任务2。

Method: 研究采用预训练的BERT模型（基于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据），并在CMED训练数据上微调，通过投票策略集成多个BERT模型的预测结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，BERT集成模型将严格Micro-F分数提高了约5%，严格Macro-F分数提高了约6%。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类的性能。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据、语言距离和语系对多语言翻译中信息损失的影响，发现数据量和语言结构关系共同影响翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是数据少或与英语差异大的语言）中仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU和BERT相似度指标分析翻译质量。

Result: 数据量可以缓解语言差异的影响，但结构上接近英语的语言在低资源条件下表现更好；语言距离指标（如拼写、语法、地理等）能预测翻译性能。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅取决于数据量，还受语言间结构和类型学关系的制约。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注需求方面潜力巨大，但其在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中的应用有限。

Result: ATGen降低了人工标注和LLM API调用成本，并在多任务中验证了效果。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一种高效的AL应用方案，开源且易于扩展。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化LLM输出视角的方法Perspective-Dial，包括Perspective Space和Systematic Prompt Engineering，用于检测和控制LLM的偏见和视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在关键任务中的广泛应用，但其输出视角和偏见的量化理解不足，需要一种方法来测量和控制LLM的视角。

Method: Perspective-Dial包含两个部分：Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 该方法能够量化并调整LLM输出的视角，适用于检测偏见、追踪公共话语中的叙事等应用。

Conclusion: Perspective-Dial为LLM的视角控制和偏见检测提供了实用工具，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多源信息，确保内容准确、全面且结构清晰，现有方法难以满足这些需求。

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科式分层结构，并以此指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的实验表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架通过分层记忆和引用模块，显著提升了生成文章的质量和可验证性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 呼吁创建更多样化的公平性基准数据集，并更谨慎地使用现有工具。

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

Motivation: 缺乏系统方法分析微调对LLM个体输出的影响。

Method: 通过跟踪隐藏状态分解微调模型为预训练和微调组件，定义TuCo量化其贡献。

Result: 对抗攻击成功时TuCo较低，表明微调影响模型安全性。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全性的影响提供了量化工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

Motivation: 自回归模型生成速度受限，成为瓶颈，需要并行化解决方案。

Result: 在多项文本生成任务中，生成速度显著提升，且质量和内存消耗无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理大表格时因输入长度限制表现不佳，需要一种方法在不重新训练模型的情况下优化输入。

Method: 提出ATF框架，利用LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，模块化地过滤无关列和行。

Result: 实验显示ATF减少约70%的表格单元，提升跨领域表格问答任务性能，但在表格事实验证任务中略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应地在不同任务中平衡信息量和简洁性，无缝集成现有模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TAIRA性能显著优于现有方法，尤其在更具挑战性的任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思想模式蒸馏和多智能体协作，有效提升了交互式推荐系统处理复杂用户意图的能力。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Result: SFT快速学习但遗忘严重，RFT学习慢但保留知识。RFT通过强化正确样本减少干扰。

Conclusion: 数据分布是遗忘的关键因素，RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

### [293] [On Recipe Memorization and Creativity in Large Language Models: Is Your Model a Creative Cook, a Bad Cook, or Merely a Plagiator?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23527)
*Jan Kvapil,Martin Fajcik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）生成的食谱中的记忆性、创造性和无意义内容，通过人工标注和自动化方法评估模型的创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析LLM在生成食谱时对记忆内容的依赖程度及其创造力，并探索自动化评估方法以扩大研究规模。

Method: 通过人工标注20个由Mixtral生成的食谱，分析其记忆性和创造性；设计自动化流程（LLM-as-judge）进行大规模评估。

Result: Mixtral倾向于重用训练数据中的食材；自动化流程中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在食材匹配上达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化方法能有效量化LLM生成内容的记忆性、创造性和无意义性，为模型创造力提供实证依据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: SemDiD通过嵌入空间操作提升语义多样性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅实现词汇多样性，限制了应用效果。

Method: SemDiD结合正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置去偏概率评估。

Result: 实验显示SemDiD在多样性和准确性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效平衡质量与多样性，提升应用性能。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs可以生成合成行为数据，但能否准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异尚不明确。研究发现，某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息的关联可被LLM复制，但其他特质存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的数据是否能准确模拟人格特质对行为的影响，特别是在新闻辨别能力方面。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的真实人类数据，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类在判断新闻标题准确性上的差异。

Result: 某些人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息的关联被成功复制，但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟行为方面具有潜力，但也存在局限性，为人工智能中认知多样性的建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，通过最小修改改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在BODEGA框架下，对BiLSTM、BERT和RoBERTa模型实现99%攻击成功率，保持文本语义和词汇相似性。

Conclusion: BeamAttack有效但存在局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

*Philip Lippmann,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料访问，无需微调即可生成领域适应嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐私敏感或资源受限环境中上下文感知嵌入方法需要目标语料库访问或领域特定微调的问题。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，供冻结的上下文感知编码器使用。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，ZEST仅使用五个示例文档的零样本合成上下文适应性能接近完全访问目标语料库的模型（差距0.5%）。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性强的嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

TL;DR: L-Zero (L0) 是一个可扩展的端到端训练管道，用于通用智能代理，通过低成本、可扩展的并发代理工作池和代码即行动的 NB-Agent 框架，显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多轮、长时任务中训练效率低和扩展性差的问题。

Method: 采用 L0 训练管道和 NB-Agent 框架，结合强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）进行训练。

Result: 在 SimpleQA 和 HotpotQA 基准测试中，准确率分别从 30% 提升到 80% 和从 22% 提升到 41%。

Conclusion: L0 系统通过高效训练和代码即行动的方法，显著提升了代理的性能，并已开源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training
recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法充分评估大型语言模型在现实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，引入22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合生成多样化测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作平均导致7.283%的准确率下降，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大，多步组合可放大对抗效果达52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需采用进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

TL;DR: 研究量化了大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，发现低不确定性时偏见几乎不存在，但随着不确定性增加，偏见呈指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在二元问题回答中是否存在位置偏见，并分析不确定性对偏见的影响。

Method: 通过改编SQuAD-it数据集，创建不同不确定性水平的版本，并评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。通过翻转选项顺序计算偏好公平性和位置一致性。

Result: 位置偏见在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。

Conclusion: 不确定性是导致位置偏见的关键因素，模型在高不确定性环境中更容易受到选项顺序的影响。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在处理简单任务时会产生冗余的思考标记，导致效率降低。本文提出DuP-PO算法，通过优化策略提升模型在有限标记预算下的推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LRMs在简单任务中因过度思考标记（如“wait”“however”）引发的不必要高推理行为，导致效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Dual Policy Preference Optimization（DuP-PO）算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑形方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提升了LRMs的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了LRMs的“思考陷阱”问题，提升了推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理基准的设计和评估方法存在缺陷，可能导致对LLM推理能力的误判，因此需要系统性审计以揭示问题并提出改进方向。

Method: 使用五个LLM（GPT-3、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-o1、LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，结合人工标注和重新评估清理后的基准子集，分析基准设计和评分方法的问题。

Result: 发现模型得分提升往往源于表面措辞变化而非推理能力改进，且模型性能对输入细微变化（如上下文可用性和措辞）高度敏感，高得分可能仅反映对格式特定线索的匹配。

Conclusion: 当前基准对LLM推理能力的评估存在局限性，需开发更注重推理过程的评估协议。论文发布了审计数据和工具以支持更可解释的模型推理评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著进步，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍表现不佳。

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化过程，结合CoT、自我反思和动态提示生成，逐步修正推理错误。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS显著优于标准CoT，并接近专用推理模型的性能。

Conclusion: MAPS通过限制反思深度平衡了性能和成本，为通用LLMs提供了高效的推理优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 评估LLMs内部知识的真实性，解决现有方法的假设缺陷。

Method: 提出sAwMIL方法，结合多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLMs内部激活状态分类陈述为真、假或中立。

Result: 在16个开源LLMs上验证，发现信号集中在模型深度第三部分，真伪信号不对称，线性探针在聊天模型中表现更好。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLMs知识提供了可靠方法，揭示了其内部知识的不对称性和复杂性。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正理解非英语语言的形态复杂性，尤其是屈折形态。

Result: LLMs在非英语语言和罕见形态模式上表现不佳，尤其是判断不合语法例子时。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言复杂性处理上存在明显不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Motivation: 社交媒体的快速扩张导致仇恨言论激增，但低资源语言因缺乏高质量数据集而面临检测挑战。

Method: 研究六种提示策略（如零样本提示、隐喻提示等），在Llama2-7B模型上测试，并与三种预训练词嵌入和三种深度学习模型对比。

Result: 隐喻提示在低资源语言（孟加拉语和印地语）及高资源语言（英语和德语）中均表现优异，并通过F1分数和环境影响因素评估。

Conclusion: 隐喻提示是一种有效的低资源语言仇恨言论检测方法，且对环境友好。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Result: 实验结果表明，新架构在因果性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAE在句子分类任务中具有潜力，新架构为解释性研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large
Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量的多语言偏好数据集资源密集，且现有数据集多为英语，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 基于结构化分类法的TaP框架，自动化生成多样化且全面的偏好数据集。

Result: 实验表明，使用TaP生成数据集训练的模型性能优于现有开源数据集，甚至超过180倍规模的数据集。

Conclusion: TaP框架为多语言偏好数据集的构建提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Conclusion: 该研究为科学传播提供了有效工具，能够识别信息失真并生成对科学传播过程的新见解。

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动主题分析（TA）方法劳动密集且难以扩展，而临床叙事中蕴含的患者和护理者体验信息丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，由专门的LLM智能体分工协作，并结合强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）优化主题相关性。

Result: 实现了对大规模定性数据集的可扩展、以患者为中心的分析，并能针对特定临床场景微调LLM。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法显著提升了主题分析的效率和准确性，为临床研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，特别是解决数学应用题的能力，以评估其作为教学工具的潜力。

Method: 通过技术概述、文献综述（213项研究）和实证评估（287道应用题）三部分，分析LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在简单应用题（s-problems）上表现优异，但在需要真实世界情境理解的问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs虽然能解决表面问题，但缺乏对真实情境的理解，限制了其在数学课堂中的教学价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Conclusion: EXPERT为图像描述评估提供了高质量的结构化解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Motivation: 前沿AI开发者依赖多层防护措施防止AI系统被滥用，但这些管线的安全性尚未明确，缺乏评估或攻击的研究。

Method: 开发并红队测试开源防御管线，比较新型少样本提示分类器与现有模型，提出STACK攻击方法并测试其效果。

Result: 少样本提示分类器在ClearHarm数据集上将攻击成功率降至0%，但STACK攻击在黑盒和转移设置中分别达到71%和33%的成功率。

Conclusion: 防御管线存在漏洞，需采用特定缓解措施应对分阶段攻击。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Motivation: 探索语言模型预测能力与嵌入空间广度的关系，并利用表示分散度提升模型性能。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量间的平均余弦距离（表示分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并应用于模型选择、检索优化及训练目标改进。

Result: 表示分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于高效模型选择、优化检索方法，并通过训练目标直接提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 表示分散度是衡量和提升语言模型性能的有效工具，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法效率低且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在提高并行段落检测效率和准确性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE模型生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估其检测能力。

Result: E5在检测并行段落方面表现最佳，AlephBERT在区分非并行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可显著提升古代文本并行段落的检测效率，为古代语言研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

Result: 较大模型生成的动作序列更接近人工指定，但较小模型表现也令人满意。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和LLM的方法可行，为机器人任务编程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

Conclusion: Ludax作为开源工具，有望推动游戏研究和相关领域的进展。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为指令跟随任务提供了一种样本高效的推理增强方法，适用于多种推理领域和模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for

### [324] [Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22919)
*Sanskar Pandey,Ruhaan Chopra,Saad Murtaza Bhat,Ark Abhyudaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto是一个轻量级的混合专家模型，通过结合GRU和FFNN专家，利用架构异质性提升推理多样性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型的静态计算路径限制了表示多样性和效率，Hecto旨在通过架构异质性解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合GRU专家（时序推理）和FFNN专家（静态抽象），采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个推理和回归任务中，Hecto性能接近或优于同质基线，同时实现专家专业化（时序vs静态）。

Conclusion: Hecto为条件计算提供了新基准，其架构多样性提升了稳定性和可解释性，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

### [325] [Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22920)
*Pinzheng Wang,Juntao Li,Zecheng Tang,Haijia Gui,Min zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过自玩（self-play）设计的Critic-Discernment Game（CDG）可以显著提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理过程中的理性能力，无需人类或高级模型的监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学和编程等任务中表现出推理能力，但它们缺乏对自身推理过程的真正理解。本文旨在探索如何通过自玩提升模型的理性。

Method: 设计了CDG游戏，其中证明者（prover）提供问题解决方案，随后接受批评者的挑战。批评者的反馈可能是帮助性或误导性的，证明者需在误导性评论中保持正确答案，并在建设性反馈中修正错误。

Result: 实验表明，CDG训练能显著提升对齐良好的LLMs在数学推理、逐步错误检测、自我修正和长链推理任务中对推理过程的理解能力。

Conclusion: 自玩方法（如CDG）是一种有效的无监督方式，可增强LLMs的推理理性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

*Yulun Jiang,Yekun Chai,Maria Brbić,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，感知能力仍是瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准多关注文本或简单多模态问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出MARBLE基准，包含M-Portal和M-Cube两个任务，需在空间、视觉和物理约束下进行多步推理。

Result: 12个先进模型在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅简化子任务中部分模型优于随机基线。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs在复杂多模态推理中的局限性，感知能力是关键瓶颈，有望推动下一代模型的发展。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个五阶段的进化框架，用于理解人工智能的发展，认为其轨迹与人类认知技术的历史进展相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的发展路径，提供一个跨学科的系统模型，解释其过去的架构变化，并为未来的研究和开发提供指导。

Method: 提出“认知几何”框架，将AI发展分为五个阶段，每个阶段对应一种革命性的表示和推理能力提升。

Result: AI的发展是自反的，当前正进入“元语言时刻”，未来将迈向“数学符号时刻”和“形式逻辑系统时刻”。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了理论基础，并为开发下一代智能系统提供了具体策略。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟风险决策行为中的表现，发现模型比人类更风险规避，且中文提示下表现偏差更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用的扩展，其模拟复杂决策行为的可靠性引发关注，尤其是风险决策场景。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较ChatGPT 4o和ChatGPT o1-mini的预测与人类实际选择，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好。

Result: 模型比人类更风险规避，o1-mini更接近人类行为；中文提示下预测偏差更大。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面有潜力，但在语言和文化场景中存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大语言模型在关系推理中的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向，如多模态推理和系统性分析推理失败原因。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于节点的消息传递机制在知识图谱中会引入噪声和信息稀释问题，需要更精准的语义上下文捕捉方法。

Method: 引入语义感知的Top-K邻居选择策略，评估节点与边的语义相关性，并通过多头注意力聚合器融合信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地捕捉和传播与链接预测任务相关的上下文信息，减少无关信息的干扰。

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 在形式概念分析（FCA）中，格的分配性缺乏标准化度量，需要一种量化方法。

Method: 引入rises的概念，用于评估概念格中的分配性，并将其与经典的meet-和join-分配性联系起来。

Result: 现实数据的概念格高度join-分配，但meet-分配性较低。

Conclusion: rises是量化分配性的有效工具，且概念格在join-分配性上表现显著。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DocVQA系统在伦理上不透明，容易产生过度自信的答案或未能传达不确定性，这在需要伦理问责的领域中存在风险。

Method: HonestVQA通过量化不确定性、使用加权损失函数对齐模型置信度，并通过对比学习强制伦理响应行为。还引入了H-Score和ECI两个评估指标。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了DocVQA的准确性和F1分数，减少了过度自信，并展示了强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和性能提升，为DocVQA系统提供了一种更可靠和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AlexNet和LSTM的混合模型，用于提高电力价格预测的准确性，优于传统的RNN和ANN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注需求和价格，未能充分分析影响价格的外部变量，导致预测不准确。

Method: 结合AlexNet的特征提取能力和LSTM的序列学习能力，引入外部变量（如需求、温度、阳光和降雨），并采用最小-最大缩放和时间窗口方法。

Result: 混合模型的预测准确率达到97.08%，高于RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）。

Conclusion: 混合模型在电力价格预测中表现出更高的准确性，证明了其优于传统方法的潜力。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

*Selin Dik,Osman Erdem,Mehmet Dik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPTZero检测AI生成文本的可靠性，发现其对纯AI内容检测准确率高，但对人类写作的区分能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生使用AI工具的增加，教师依赖AI检测工具（如GPTZero）来识别AI生成文本，但其可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 研究使用不同长度的随机提交论文（短、中、长），将28篇AI生成和50篇人类写作的论文输入GPTZero，测量AI生成百分比和置信度。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高（91-100%），但人类写作存在误判，表明GPTZero在区分人类文本时不可靠。

Conclusion: 教育者应谨慎依赖AI检测工具，因其对人类文本的识别能力有限。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

TL;DR: ChemActor是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的化学执行器，用于将非结构化的实验步骤转换为结构化的动作序列，通过LLM生成的数据框架解决标注数据不足和质量低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人合成在有机化学中的兴趣增加，自动化从文献中提取化学步骤变得至关重要，但化学语言的模糊性和高标注成本使其具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ChemActor，一个完全微调的LLM，结合数据选择模块和多轮LLM循环评估指标，生成机器可执行的动作序列。

Result: 在反应到描述（R2D）和描述到动作（D2A）任务中，ChemActor性能优于基线模型10%。

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据框架，显著提升了化学实验步骤的自动化提取性能。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中动态和不确定环境下协调不足的问题，现有方法泛化能力差或训练成本高。

Method: 利用交互历史预测合作伙伴行为，无需显式监督或微调，通过多样化的代理对训练。

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中显著优于基线方法，人类评估确认其为最有效的协作伙伴。

Conclusion: CooT在多智能体场景中表现出强大的适应性、灵活性和上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: MMReason是一个新的基准测试，旨在全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的长链推理能力，通过多样、开放和具有挑战性的问题，填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，包括缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响，以及对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: MMReason通过从多个学科和难度级别筛选问题，采用开放形式和多模型投票技术消除猜测和记忆影响，并设计基于参考的三元评分机制评估推理步骤。

Result: MMReason对主流MLLMs进行了基准测试，并深入分析了它们的推理能力。

Conclusion: MMReason有望成为推动MLLM推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统作为防御越狱攻击的有效性。

Method: 比较单智能体与多智能体配置，评估三种越狱策略。

Result: 多智能体系统减少漏报，但效果因攻击类型而异，且增加误报和计算开销。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限，需改进对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的自动化方法，用于迭代调整强化学习代理的奖励函数权重，以解决游戏内容或机制修改时奖励权重不再最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在游戏中部署强化学习代理时，设计有效的奖励函数通常需要专家，且游戏内容或机制修改后，原有奖励权重可能不再适用。

Method: 利用语言模型根据用户定义的行为目标和先前训练轮次的性能统计，迭代提出更新的奖励权重，实现自动化调整。

Result: 在赛车任务中，语言模型引导的代理性能显著提升，成功率从9%增至74%，最终达到80%的成功率和855时间步，接近专家调整的94%和850时间步。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动奖励工程，通过语言模型的自校正能力，实现了代理行为的逐步优化，性能接近专家设计。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

Motivation: 病理学数据受中心特定条件影响大，现有方法仅关注图像块而非全幻灯片图像（WSI），无法满足临床需求。

Method: 提出HASD框架，包含层次化适应模块（特征对齐、几何不变性正则化、注意力一致性正则化）和原型选择机制。

Result: 在两个任务中，HER2分级AUROC提升4.1%，UCEC生存预测C-index提升3.9%。

Conclusion: HASD为病理学机构提供了一种实用可靠的幻灯片级域适应方案，降低了计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct
strategic behaviors.

Motivation: AI在安全关键系统中缺乏安全保障，需要结合控制理论和AI技术来解决这一问题。

Result: 提出了一种通用的安全分析和保障框架，适用于不同AI系统和应用。

Conclusion: 通过数据控制的新视角，可以推动AI工程在安全保障方面的跨学科创新。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to

even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a

Motivation: 传统方法中，求解单词方程的顺序对性能影响较大，需优化。

Method: 提出基于图的表示方法，利用GNN进行排序，并结合最小不可满足子集（MUS）训练。

Result: 在变量出现次数受限的基准测试中，新方法优于现有求解器。

Conclusion: GNN排序方法有效提升了单词方程求解效率。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Method: 利用集中式专家数据对预训练的MAPF-GPT模型进行微调，并采用delta-data生成机制加速训练。

Result: 在多种测试场景下，MAPF-GPT-DDG的性能优于现有基于学习的MAPF求解器，包括原始MAPF-GPT，并能处理单环境中多达100万智能体的实例。

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG为MAPF领域设定了新的可扩展性里程碑，展示了机器学习在复杂路径规划问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Motivation: 随着自主AI代理能力的提升，其安全风险（如记忆污染、工具滥用等）超越了传统系统或独立LLM的威胁模型，亟需系统性研究。

Conclusion: R2A2架构通过风险感知建模和联合奖励-风险优化，为自主代理提供了主动安全决策支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective

Motivation: 当前最先进的AI系统在演绎推理任务中表现不佳，无法实现通用人工智能的梦想。

Method: 提出从统计性能优化转向精确学习范式，要求在所有输入上正确。

Result: 精确学习是实现可靠演绎推理的关键。

Conclusion: 精确学习应成为算法设计的指导目标。

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在运筹学中解决随机建模问题的潜力，填补其在该领域的研究空白。

Method: 手动收集研究生课程和博士资格考试题目，测试LLMs解决能力，并利用SimOpt库评估其在不确定性下的实际决策能力。

Result: LLMs在解决随机建模问题时表现与人类专家相当，但仍需进一步工作以实现可靠自动化。

Conclusion: LLMs在运筹学中具有辅助研究和自动化应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Conclusion: 工业大脑填补了工业链韧性预测和规划的重要空白，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

applications that build on a GPAI/foundation model. This document facilitates
conformity with or use of leading AI risk management-related standards,
adapting and building on the generic voluntary guidance in the NIST AI Risk
Management Framework and ISO/IEC 23894, with a focus on the unique issues faced
by developers of GPAI/foundation models.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解和处理非马尔可夫动态提供了理论支持，并提升了决策算法的评估能力。

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

TL;DR: SPIRAL是一个通过自博弈框架训练语言模型的强化学习方法，无需人工监督，生成无限难度递增的问题，提升模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注和领域特定奖励设计，SPIRAL旨在通过自博弈实现自主推理能力的提升。

Method: 采用自博弈框架，多轮零和游戏对抗，结合在线多智能体强化学习系统和角色条件优势估计（RAE）稳定训练。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker上训练的模型在数学和通用推理任务上分别提升8.6%和8.4%，多游戏训练进一步强化性能。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然发展可迁移的推理能力，为自主推理开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.
