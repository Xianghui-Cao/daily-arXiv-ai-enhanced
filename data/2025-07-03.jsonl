Inspired by a recent\ncombinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere\ntriangulations constructed from trees, called the \\emph{triple-tree} class, we\npresent a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning\ntrees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the\ntriangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be\nviewed as a bipartite graph, called the \\emph{middle graph} of the\ntriangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a\ntree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase\nstructure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph\ncomes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components\nand loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows\none to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted\ntree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of\na new phase, referred to as the \\emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar\ncrumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase\ntransitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to\ntriple-tree phase transition is continuous."}

Using tensor network methods, we\nstudy the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between\ntwo static charges in the $2+1$D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We\ncalculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string\nconfigurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances\ndetermined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various\nstring breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance\nstrings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields,\nwe fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in\nmaximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical\nregime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the\nlatter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and\ntrapped-ion quantum processors."}
