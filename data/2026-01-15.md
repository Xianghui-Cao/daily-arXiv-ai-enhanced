TL;DR: The paper discusses the progress in extracting observables from semileptonic heavy-meson decays using lattice QCD, covering both inclusive and exclusive decays. It addresses systematic uncertainties, compares form factors with previous results, and aims to unify the treatment of these decays for resolving the Vcb puzzle. Future work will focus on controlling systematic effects and reducing statistical errors.

Motivation: The motivation is to advance the understanding and accuracy of semileptonic heavy-meson decay processes, which are important for addressing the Vcb puzzle, by unifying the lattice treatment of both inclusive and exclusive decays and improving the control over systematic and statistical uncertainties.

Method: The method involves the use of lattice QCD four-point correlators to extract observables. For inclusive decays, it includes estimating systematic uncertainties through a Chebyshev expansion. For exclusive decays, BCL parameterizations and HQET-based parameterization of P-wave form factors are used. The study uses lattice ensembles provided by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration.

Result: Results include the estimation of systematic uncertainties for inclusive decays, comparison of fitted coefficients for pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors with HPQCD's earlier results, and a new perspective on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle via HQET-based parameterization. The work sets the stage for further refinement of the methods and reduction of errors.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this work represents a significant step towards a unified approach to studying semileptonic heavy-meson decays, which is critical for addressing the Vcb puzzle. Future research will aim to improve the control of systematic effects and explore techniques to reduce statistical errors.

Abstract: We report the recent progress from our group in extracting observables of both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic heavy-meson decays directly from lattice QCD four-point correlators. On the inclusive side, we illustrate how to estimate the systematic uncertainties from omitted higher-order terms and non-zero smearing of the kernel approximation, building on two important features of the Chebyshev expansion. On the exclusive side, we perform BCL parameterizations of the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors and compare the fitted coefficients with those from earlier results by HPQCD. We also perform a HQET-based parameterization of the P-wave form factors to shed new light on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle. This work constitutes a step toward a unified lattice treatment of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays, relevant for the Vcb puzzle. In this study, we use lattice ensembles from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration for numerical investigations. Future developments from our group will focus on the control of other systematic effects for inclusive decays and investigations of other techniques with reduced statistical errors to extract exclusive contributions from lattice four-point correlators.
