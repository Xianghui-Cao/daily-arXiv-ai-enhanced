TL;DR: The paper presents high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros and the temperature of the critical endpoint in QCD, with a discussion on systematic errors and methodological caveats.

Motivation: To understand the behavior of QCD at finite baryochemical potential by estimating the location of the critical endpoint and the Lee-Yang zeros through lattice QCD simulations, while accounting for systematic errors and limitations of the method.

Method: High-statistics lattice QCD simulations were conducted using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. Taylor expansion coefficients of pressure were calculated, and rational function approximations of the free energy were constructed, which obey charge conjugation symmetry and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. The positions of Lee-Yang zeros and the temperature of the critical endpoint were estimated, and the results were fitted to ansatz motivated by 3D Ising critical point behavior.

Result: The study found that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or does not exist. Additionally, the paper identifies some caveats of the method that persist even with high statistics, and discusses how future studies might address these issues.

Conclusion: The analysis provides an estimation of the critical endpoint's temperature in QCD and highlights the importance of considering systematic errors and methodological limitations in such studies. Future high-statistics lattice analyses could potentially resolve some of the current method's caveats.

Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved
staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor
expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical
potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary
chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function
approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly
satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity,
which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to
estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential
plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros
is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free
energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to
estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources
of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$
probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature
or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not
disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We
discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics
lattice analyses.
