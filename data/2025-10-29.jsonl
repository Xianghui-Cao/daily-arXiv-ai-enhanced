In the absence of any\nadditional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to\nbind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise\nto an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron''\nbound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by\nbeing off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation\nof this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product\nstate techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to\nperform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on\nhadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its\nformation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern\nquantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions."}

Using numerical\nsimulations of lattice Yang-Mills theory, we show that the test quark is\nconfined to the neutral mirror by an attractive potential of the Cornell type,\nsuggesting the existence of a mirror-bound one-quark state, a \"quarkiton\".\nSurprisingly, the tension of the string spanned between the quark and the\nmirror is lower than the fundamental string tension. The quarkiton state\nexhibits a partial confinement: while the quark is localized in the vicinity of\nthe mirror, it can still travel freely along it. Such quarkiton states share\nsimilarity with the surface excitons in metals and semiconductors that are\nbound to their negatively charged images at a boundary. The quarkitons can\nexist at the hadronic side of the phase interfaces in QCD that arise, for\nexample, in the thermodynamic equilibrium of vortical quark-gluon plasma."}

I", "comment": "38 pages", "summary": "I study the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration for the Dirac\nspectrum in finite-temperature gauge theories in the two-flavor chiral limit,\nusing Ginsparg--Wilson fermions on the lattice. I prove that chiral symmetry is\nrestored at the level of the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar\nbilinears if and only if all these susceptibilities do not diverge in the\nchiral limit $m\\to 0$, with $m$ the common mass of the light fermions. This\nimplies in turn that they are infinitely differentiable functions of $m^2$ at\n$m=0$, or $m$ times such a function, depending on whether they contain an even\nor odd number of isosinglet bilinears. Expressing scalar and pseudoscalar\nsusceptibilities in terms of the Dirac spectrum, I use their finiteness in the\nsymmetric phase to derive constraints on the spectrum, and discuss the\nresulting implications for the fate of the anomalous $\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry\nin the chiral limit. I also discuss the differentiability properties of\nspectral quantities with respect to $m^2$, and show from first principles that\nthe topological properties of the theory in the chiral limit are characterized\nby an instanton gas-like behavior if $\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ remains effectively\nbroken."}

By formulating quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice in\nimaginary time, such integrations can be carried out non-perturbatively using a\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling. The energies of\nstationary states in the finite volume of the lattice can be extracted from the\ntemporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering\n$K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy\nspectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the\nbest-fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those that produce a\nfinite-volume spectrum which most closely matches that obtained from the Monte\nCarlo computations. Results for the $\\Delta$ resonance are presented, and a\nstudy of scattering for energies near the $\\Lambda(1405)$ resonance is\noutlined, showing a two pole structure. The prospects for applying this\nmethodology to the Roper resonance are discussed."}
