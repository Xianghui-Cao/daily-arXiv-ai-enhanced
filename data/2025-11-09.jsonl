We focus on operators that do\nnot mix with lower-dimensional operators by virtue of their transformation\nproperties under the flavor-symmetry group. This class includes all $\\Delta F =\n2$ operators, as well as their partners that transform under the same\nirreducible representations of the flavor group. These encompass a substantial\nsubset of $\\Delta F = 1$ and $\\Delta F = 0$ operators. The present analysis\nprovides a detailed classification of all four-quark operators, exploring their\nFierz identities, symmetry properties, and mixing patterns. Different variants\nof GIRS are explored, including a democratic version that treats all mixing\noperators uniformly. For selected variants, which exhibit smaller mixing\neffects, we present the conversion matrices from GIRS to the\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at next-to-leading order."}
