### [1] [Studying properties of the SU(2) QCD by lattice field theory methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19789)
*Ilya Kudrov,Vitaly Bornyakov,Vladimir Goy*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents new findings on the properties of $SU(2)$ QCD in lattice regularization, with a focus on determining the confinement-deconfinement transition line in the $\mu - T$ plane using the Polyakov loop and string tension.

Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the phase structure of $SU(2)$ QCD by identifying the transition between confinement and deconfinement phases as a function of chemical potential ($\mu$) and temperature (T).

Method: The method involves computing the Polyakov loop and the string tension within the framework of lattice QCD to map out the transition line in the $\mu - T$ plane.

Result: The results include the determination of the confinement-deconfinement transition line in the $\mu - T$ plane for $SU(2)$ QCD, which provides insights into the phase diagram of the theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely summarize the significance of the determined transition line for understanding the behavior of $SU(2)$ QCD under varying conditions of chemical potential and temperature, and its implications for the broader field of quantum chromodynamics.

Abstract: We present new results on properties of $SU(2)$ QCD in lattice regularization. Our main goal is to find the transition line confinement - deconfinement in $μ- T$ plane. We compute the Polyakov loop and the string tension to determine this line.
