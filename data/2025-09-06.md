TL;DR: The paper presents a first-principles calculation of the long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude for the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay using lattice QCD, with 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part. It also determines a destructive interference between long- and short-distance parts of the decay amplitude.

Motivation: The motivation is to compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange contribution to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, which has not been accurately determined before, especially the interference pattern with the short-distance contributions.

Method: The method involves using a physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble in lattice QCD at an inverse lattice spacing of 1.023 GeV, along with a QED$_\infty$-based formalism. The researchers detail their implementation strategies for all five non-SU(3)-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies.

Result: The result is a 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of the long-distance amplitude, and the determination of a destructive interference with the short-distance parts. The accuracy is constrained by the reconstruction of the physical contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, with various strategies being tested and compared.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study provides a significant advancement in understanding the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, particularly in terms of the long-distance effects and their interference with the short-distance contributions, though the precision is currently limited by the treatment of the $\eta$ intermediate state.

Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which
contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice
QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an
inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism.
Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed
diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision
on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. For the first time, a
destructive interference between the long- and short-distance parts of the
decay amplitude is determined from a first-principles calculation. The
precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical
contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are
tested and compared.
