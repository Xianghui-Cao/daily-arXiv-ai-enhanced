However, even\nthough they are successful in describing many of these low lying QCD states,\nthey and their properties have been difficult to pin down. Here we present\nprogress in studying diquarks in a gauge-invariant setup through embedding them\nin a parent hadron containing a heavy spectator quark using lattice QCD\ncalculations."}

By analyzing zero-momentum matrix\nelements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence\nassociated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix\nelements in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual\nself-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs\nwithin the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large\nseparations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results\ndemonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth,\ncontinuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier\ntransformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability\nof both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs,\nproviding a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes."}

In this letter, we present a general argument, inspired by\ncurrent-meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, to\nidentify which excited states are enhanced by the choice of the inserted\ncurrent and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence across\nmultiple hadronic channels and provides both a conceptual understanding and\npractical guidance to account for excited-state effects in hadron three-point\nfunction analyses."}
