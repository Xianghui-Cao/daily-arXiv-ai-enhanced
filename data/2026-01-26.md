### [1] [Z2 Lattice Gauge Theory on Non-trivial Topology and Its Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16776)
*Jiaqi Hu,Shu Tian,Xiaopeng Cui,Rebing Wu,Man-Hong Yung,Yu Shi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper extends Wegner duality to any topology and dimension, leading to a new type of Ising model that reduces the qubit requirement for simulating Z2 lattice gauge theory, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices.

Motivation: The motivation is to make the simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory more accessible on near-term quantum devices by reducing the number of required qubits and simplifying the coupling requirements.

Method: The authors extend the concept of Wegner duality to apply to any topological space and dimension, creating a new class of Ising models where the topology is represented through non-local domain-wall patterns. This approach avoids the need for gauge constraints, which usually complicate the simulation.

Result: By using this new model, the simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory on an L*L torus can be achieved with only L*L qubits and two-body couplings, significantly reducing the complexity compared to the traditional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits setup.

Conclusion: The extension of Wegner duality allows for a more efficient and practical simulation of Z2 lattice gauge theory, potentially enabling its full experimental realization on current and near-future quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Wegner duality is essential for Z2 lattice gauge theory, yet the duality on non-trivial topologies has remained implicit. We extend Wegner duality to arbitrary topology and dimension, obtaining a new class of Ising models, in which topology is encoded in non-local domain-wall patterns. Without the overhead of gauge constraints, simulating this model on an L*L torus requires only L*L qubits with two-body couplings, halving the conventional four-body coupled 2L*L qubits, enabling full experimental realization of Z2 lattice gauge theory on near-term devices.

### [2] [Coupled-channel approach to isotensor $πππ$ scattering from lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16916)
*Yuchuan Feng,Chris Culver,Michael Döring,Maxim Mai,Andrei Alexandru,Frank X. Lee*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the dynamics of a three-body system with isospin I=2 using lattice QCD, analyzing its finite-volume spectrum and comparing it to predictions from an effective Lagrangian at leading order, while also performing chiral extrapolations for different pion masses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD, focusing on a system that has no three-body resonance but features a resonance in a sub-channel, and is a coupled-channel problem.

Method: The method involves calculating the finite-volume spectrum using lattice QCD, mapping the amplitude to infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigating the limit of a narrow ρ, and performing chiral extrapolations between different pion masses.

Result: Results include the calculated finite-volume spectra, the mapped amplitudes to the infinite volume, the investigation of the narrow ρ limit, and the comparison with the effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order, as well as the chiral extrapolation outcomes.

Conclusion: The conclusion would be the validation or refutation of the theoretical framework used, the accuracy of the effective Lagrangian prediction, and insights into the three-body dynamics of the isospin I=2 system, including the behavior of the system with varying pion masses.

Abstract: The quest to understand three-body dynamics from first-principle QCD includes the study of non-resonant and resonant systems. The isospin $I=2$ system is of particular interest having no three-body resonance but featuring a resonance in a sub-channel, while also being a coupled-channel problem. In this study, we calculate the finite-volume spectrum from lattice QC at two different pion masses, map the amplitude to the infinite volume through a generalized FVU three-body quantization condition, investigate the limit of a narrow $ρ$, and compare with an effective Lagrangian prediction at leading order. Chiral extrapolations between different pion masses are performed.
