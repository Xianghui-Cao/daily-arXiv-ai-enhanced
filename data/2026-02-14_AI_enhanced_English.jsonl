This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\u03c0=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the use of the Coulomb gauge method in lattice QCD to calculate nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs) without Wilson lines, showing promising results for valence-quark PDFs and identifying challenges with full-quark-channel PDFs due to excited-state contamination.", "motivation": "The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations for parton distributions by using a novel approach that avoids the need for Wilson lines, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET).", "method": "The method involves implementing the Coulomb gauge approach on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with specific parameters, including lattice spacing, volume, and pion mass, and using boosted nucleon states to compute unpolarized, helicity, and transversity PDFs from the real and imaginary parts of correlators.", "result": "Results show good convergence and compatibility with global analyses for valence-quark PDFs, while discrepancies are found in full-quark-channel PDFs, likely due to excited-state contamination, especially at lower nucleon momenta.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the Coulomb gauge approach is effective for calculating nucleon PDFs, particularly for valence-quark structures, and serves as a foundation for its further application, despite challenges identified in the full-quark-channel PDFs."}}
