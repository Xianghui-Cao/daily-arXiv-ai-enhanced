In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations."}

From the theoretical side, the obvious non-perturbative approach is lattice QCD simulations, which are, however, obstructed by a severe sign problem. Here we employ the O(4) non-linear $σ$-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class. We assume high temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, with topological charge taking the role of the baryon number, along the lines of Skyrme's model. In this effective formulation, the baryonic chemical potential $μ_{B}$ can be included in the lattice formulation without causing any sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations. This allows us to pin down the critical line, i.e. the critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}(μ_{B})$, which decreases monotonically for increasing $μ_{B}$. In the range $0 < μ_{B} \\lesssim 309~{\\rm MeV}$ and $132~{\\rm MeV} \\gtrsim T_{\\rm c} \\gtrsim 106~{\\rm MeV}$, we do not find a Critical Endpoint (CEP), although there are hints for it to be in the vicinity of the maximal $μ_{B}$-value that we could explore."}

We build on an iterative approach that has been previously proposed and is implemented by using the worm algorithm. We simulate an improved XY model, that has next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest ones. In the worm update we incorporate weights, which allows us to obtain accurate results up to $q=64$. For example we get $Y_q=1.76370(12)$, $0.89167(23)$, and $-0.11203(34)$ for $q=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory gives an excellent agreement down to $q=4$ and provides accurate estimates of the parameters of the effective field theory."}
