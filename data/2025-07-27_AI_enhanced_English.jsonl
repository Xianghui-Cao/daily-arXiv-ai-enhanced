Using\nthe formalism developed in Ref.~\\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of\nsynthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is\ndemonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\\\"uscher approach, the\ntruncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final\nresult. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified\nL\\\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising\nwithin the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization\nscheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range\nexpansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new numerical algorithm for the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function is presented, which is robust against truncation of higher partial waves and allows for natural-sized effective range expansion parameters after renormalization.", "motivation": "The motivation is to improve upon the standard L\u00fcscher approach by providing a more efficient and accurate method for calculating the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function, especially in the presence of long-range forces, and to address the issues with cutoff regularization.", "method": "The paper utilizes a formalism from a previous study on synthetic data of finite-volume energy levels in a toy model to develop a numerical algorithm. The work also includes a detailed discussion on the regularization and renormalization of the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function, introducing a new renormalization scheme.", "result": "The results show that the truncation of higher partial waves has a minimal impact on the final result, and the new renormalization scheme leads to modified effective range expansion parameters of natural size across all partial waves.", "conclusion": "The proposed algorithm and renormalization scheme provide an improved method for handling the modified L\u00fcscher zeta-function, particularly in the context of long-range forces, with better accuracy and without the significant influence of higher partial wave truncations."}}
