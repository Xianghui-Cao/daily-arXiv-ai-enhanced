The additional Higgs doublet enlarges the\nscalar spectrum and opens the possibility for spontaneous breaking of the\nglobal symmetry. In this work we start by showing the occurrence of spontaneous\nbreaking of the custodial symmetry in a region of the parameter space of the\nmodel. Following this, both the spectrum and the running of the gauge coupling\nare examined at weak quartic couplings in the presence of the custodial\nsymmetry. The calculations are performed with energy cutoffs ranging from 300\nto 600 GeV on a line of constant standard model physics, obtained by tuning\nbare couplings to fix the ratio between the masses of the Higgs and the $W$\nbosons, as well as the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the scale of\nthe $W$ boson mass. The realizable masses for the additional scalar states are\nexplored. For the choice of bare quartic couplings in this work, the estimated\nlower bound of these masses is found to be well below the $W$ boson mass, and\nindependent of the cutoff. We also study the finite temperature electroweak\ntransition along this line of constant standard model physics, revealing\nproperties of a smooth crossover behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model on a lattice, revealing spontaneous breaking of custodial symmetry, and examines the spectrum and running of the gauge coupling. It also investigates the mass range for additional scalar states and the nature of the electroweak transition at finite temperatures.", "motivation": "The motivation is to investigate the non-perturbative aspects of the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model, particularly the spontaneous breaking of global symmetry, the spectrum, and the behavior of the gauge coupling, as well as the electroweak transition at finite temperatures.", "method": "The method involves numerical simulations on a lattice with energy cutoffs ranging from 300 to 600 GeV, while maintaining a line of constant standard model physics by tuning bare couplings to fix the ratio between Higgs and W boson masses and the value of the renormalized gauge coupling at the W boson mass scale.", "result": "Results show that spontaneous breaking of custodial symmetry occurs in a region of the parameter space, and the lower bound of the masses for the additional scalar states is found to be below the W boson mass, independent of the cutoff. The electroweak transition at finite temperature exhibits a smooth crossover behavior.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the $SU(2){-}$gauged custodial two-Higgs-doublet model can exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and provides insights into the mass spectrum of additional scalars and the characteristics of the electroweak phase transition at finite temperatures."}}
