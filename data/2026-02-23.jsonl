Lee", "Andrei Alexandru"], "title": "Higher order quantization conditions for two-body scattering with spin", "comment": "53 pages, 3 figures, 26 tables, 1 supplement", "summary": "We examine the Lüscher quantization condition to high order for the scattering of a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle in a periodic box. First, we derive the quantization conditions in a non-relativistic framework up to total angular momentum $J=11/2$ in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for both rest and moving frames. Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations. In all, we validated 19 quantization conditions (12 in cubic box, 7 in elongated box). This is a necessary step in applying the method in precision studies of systems in finite volume with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering."}

This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics."}

Marinkovic"], "title": "Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation", "comment": "19 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model."}
