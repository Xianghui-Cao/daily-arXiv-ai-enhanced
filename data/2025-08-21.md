### [1] [Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512)
*Michael Mandl,Erhard Seiler,DÃ©nes Sexty*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces and tests a set of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations, showing that if certain criteria are met, the expectation values of observables are correct. These conditions are also applicable to general probability densities on complex manifolds. The effectiveness of these criteria is demonstrated through simple toy models.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to establish a robust framework for validating the results from complex Langevin simulations, which can be applied without requiring exact solutions to the problem at hand. This is important because it allows for a more reliable use of such simulations in theoretical physics, especially when dealing with theories that have complex actions or are otherwise difficult to solve.

Method: The authors derive a family of correctness conditions based on the Schwinger-Dyson equations and specific bounds that must be satisfied by the expectation values of all observables within a particular space. They then apply these conditions to test their validity using one- and two-dimensional toy models as case studies.

Result: The derived correctness conditions are found to be effective in ruling out incorrect results in the tested toy models. This suggests that the proposed criteria can serve as a valuable tool for assessing the reliability of complex Langevin simulation outcomes in more complex scenarios as well.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the newly derived correctness conditions provide a practical and reliable way to validate the results of complex Langevin simulations. It further emphasizes the broader applicability of these conditions to general probability densities on complex manifolds, opening up new possibilities for their use in various theoretical and computational physics contexts.

Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin
simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation
values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's
Schwinger--Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation
values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in
the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general
probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on
a real manifold. We test these criteria in a few simple one- and
two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out
incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.
