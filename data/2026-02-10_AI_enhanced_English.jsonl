One of the ensembles is at the physical pion mass, and one has a fine lattice spacing $a\\sim 0.05 ~\\text{fm}$. We determine the coupling constants to be $g_{D^{\\ast+} D^+ \u03b3} = -0.205(35)$ GeV$^{-1}$, $g_{D^{\\ast0} D^0 \u03b3} = 2.20(27)$ GeV$^{-1}$, and $g_{D_s^{\\ast+} D_s^+ \u03b3} = -0.125(21)$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively. Compared with previous studies, our results demonstrate significant improvements in precision. In particular, we carefully estimate the systematic uncertainty arising from matrix element fits, momentum transfer extrapolations, and chiral and continuum limit extrapolations, which are included in the reported total uncertainties. These couplings yield the following predictions of decay widths: $\u0393_{D^{\\ast+} \\rightarrow D^+ \u03b3} = 0.255(87)$ keV, $\u0393_{D^{\\ast0} \\rightarrow D^0 \u03b3} = 29.4(7.2)$ keV, and $\u0393_{D_s^{\\ast+}\\rightarrow D_s^+ \u03b3} = 0.102(34)$ keV. This work establishes first-principles results of the charmed meson radiative transitions and provides inputs for understanding the structure and properties of heavy-light mesons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this approach, evaluating the derivatives of the partition function up to order $k$ increases the matrix-multiplication cost by a factor of $(k+1)(k+2)/2$ compared to computing the free energy alone, while the memory footprint is only $k$ times that of the original calculation. In the limit where the derivatives of the SVD are neglected, we establish a theoretical correspondence between our forward-mode AD and conventional impurity methods. Numerically, we find that the proposed AD algorithm can calculate internal energy and specific heat significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at comparable computational cost. We also provide a practical procedure to extract critical exponents from derivatives of the renormalized tensor in TRG calculations in both two and three dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "A forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) framework for tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods is proposed, enabling more accurate calculations of internal energy and specific heat, with a practical procedure to extract critical exponents in TRG calculations.", "motivation": "The motivation is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of calculating derivatives of the partition function in tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods, which are essential for determining thermodynamic properties like internal energy and specific heat, as well as for extracting critical exponents in phase transitions.", "method": "The method involves developing a forward-mode AD framework that integrates with TRG. The AD framework increases computational cost by a predictable factor when computing higher-order derivatives, while maintaining a manageable memory footprint. The authors also establish a theoretical connection between their AD approach and conventional impurity methods.", "result": "The results show that the AD algorithm can compute internal energy and specific heat with significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at a similar computational cost. Additionally, the paper provides a procedure to calculate critical exponents from the derivatives of the renormalized tensor in both 2D and 3D TRG calculations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the forward-mode AD framework for TRG methods offers a more precise and efficient way to compute physical quantities and critical exponents, outperforming traditional impurity methods in terms of accuracy without a significant increase in computational resources."}}
