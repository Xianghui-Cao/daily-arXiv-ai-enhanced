Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial\nstates remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield\nground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle,\nguide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to\nbridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting\nscalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve\ncomparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local\nnon-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo\ndata, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum\ncircuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity\nscales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically\nleveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in\nquantum field theories of interest in nature."}

The calculation is performed using\nunphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\\pi}\n\\approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance.\nThe analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively\nrelates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their\ninfinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results\nfor $\\pi\\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the\nisospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic\nlattice volumes with box length ranging from $\\approx 4/m_\\pi$ to $6/m_\\pi$.\nThese combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the\ninfinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled\nintegral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes."}

We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing\nopen boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using\na non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions\nare gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational\ncosts of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$\nYang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a\nclear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we\ncheck at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this\napproach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions\nin the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the\npurely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more\nefficient future flow-based solutions."}
