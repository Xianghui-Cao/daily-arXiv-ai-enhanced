TL;DR: The authors used high-statistics lattice simulations with 4HEX improved staggered fermions to calculate the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure up to the tenth order at zero and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. They constructed rational function approximations for the free energy, taking into account charge conjugation symmetry and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. The Lee-Yang zeros were estimated in the complex chemical potential plane, and their temperature dependence was fitted using models based on the 3D Ising critical point. The analysis suggests that with 84% probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below 103 MeV or does not exist. The paper also discusses systematic errors and limitations of the method.

Motivation: The motivation for this study is to estimate the position of the chiral critical endpoint in QCD, which is a key feature in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. Understanding the location and nature of this endpoint is important for both theoretical and experimental studies in nuclear and particle physics, as it can provide insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in heavy-ion collisions or in the early universe.

Method: The researchers employed high-statistics lattice QCD simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. They calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential. A rational function approximation for the free energy was constructed, ensuring it satisfies the exact properties of QCD, including charge conjugation symmetry and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. This allowed them to estimate the Lee-Yang zeros and fit their temperature dependence to models derived from the universal behavior near a 3D Ising critical point, which is a standard model for second-order phase transitions.

Result: The study resulted in an estimation of the chiral critical endpoint's temperature, concluding that with 84% probability, it is either below 103 MeV or does not exist. The findings are based on a single lattice spacing and include a discussion on systematic errors and the caveats of the method, even with the high statistics used in the simulations. The work also points out the need for future high statistics lattice analyses to further reduce uncertainties and improve the precision of the results.

Conclusion: The research concludes that the chiral critical endpoint is likely to be at a temperature below 103 MeV or may not exist, based on the current high-statistics lattice QCD simulations. The authors highlight the importance of considering systematic errors and the limitations of the methods used, suggesting that future studies with more refined techniques and possibly different lattice spacings could help to better constrain the position of the critical endpoint.

Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved
staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor
expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical
potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary
chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function
approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly
satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity,
which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to
estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential
plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros
is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free
energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to
estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources
of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$
probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature
or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not
disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We
discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics
lattice analyses.
