Thanks to this algorithm I am able to\nexplore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to\nprecisely determine $\\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous\nstudies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum\nlimit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the\nindependence of the continuum limit of $\\chi$ from this choice. I conclude\nproviding a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous\ndeterminations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at\nfinite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility (\u03c7) in SU(N) Yang-Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the PTBC algorithm, allowing for finer lattice spacings and demonstrating the independence of the continuum limit of \u03c7 from the choice of smoothing radius.", "motivation": "To accurately determine the topological susceptibility across a range of N values (3 \u2264 N \u2264 6) and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm in overcoming topological freezing for N > 3, enabling exploration of finer lattice spacings and ensuring the independence of the results from the choice of boundary conditions.", "method": "Non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations are employed with the PTBC algorithm to explore a uniform range of lattice spacing for various N values. The study also takes the continuum limit at a fixed smoothing radius in physical units to show the independence of the result from this parameter.", "result": "The author was able to precisely determine the topological susceptibility for finer lattice spacings than previous studies that used periodic or open boundary conditions. The continuum limit of the topological susceptibility is shown to be independent of the smoothing radius in physical units.", "conclusion": "The new PTBC results provide an accurate determination of the topological susceptibility and confirm its independence from the smoothing radius in the continuum limit, offering a comprehensive comparison with previous determinations in the literature for both finite N and the large-N limit."}}
