Although such fields are expected in off-central heavy-ion\ncollisions, directly measuring their experimental imprints remains extremely\nchallenging. To address this, we propose the baryon-electric charge\ncorrelations $\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\\mu_{\\rm\nQ}/\\mu_{\\rm B}$ as magnetic-field-sensitive probes, based on (2+1)-flavor QCD\nlattice simulations at physical pion masses. Along the transition line,\n$\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\\mu_{\\rm Q}/\\mu_{\\rm B})_{\\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb\ncollisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \\simeq 8M_\\pi^2$,\nrespectively. To bridge theoretical predictions and experimental observations,\nwe construct HRG-based proxies and apply systematic kinematic cuts to emulate\nSTAR and ALICE detector acceptances. Furthermore, we extend this investigation\nto the QCD equation of state, and examine the leading-order thermodynamic\ncoefficients for strangeness-neutral scenarios up to $eB \\simeq 0.8 {\\rm GeV}^2\n\\sim 45 m_{\\pi}^2$, revealing intriguing non-monotonic structures."}
