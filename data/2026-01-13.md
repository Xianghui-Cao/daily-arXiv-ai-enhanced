### [1] [Phase structure of heavy dense lattice QCD and three-state Potts model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06446)
*Shinji Ejiri,Masanari Koiida*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the phase transition in QCD at high quark density and mass, using an effective theory that simplifies to a 3D three-state Potts model. It concludes that a first-order phase transition likely exists in the high-density heavy-quark region of QCD.

Motivation: To understand the finite temperature phase transition of QCD under varying particle density and quark mass, specifically in the high-density heavy-quark limit.

Method: An effective theory is used where the Polyakov loop, an order parameter for $Z_3$ symmetry, is replaced with $Z_3$ spin, transforming the model into a 3D three-state Potts model with a complex external field term.

Result: The phase structure analysis of the Potts model shows a first-order phase transition at low density, a crossover at a critical point, and a return to a first-order phase transition at high density.

Conclusion: The study suggests the presence of a first-order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD, which is inferred from the behavior of the 3D three-state Potts model across different densities.

Abstract: The nature of the finite temperature phase transition of QCD depends on the particle density and the mass of the dynamical quarks. We discuss the properties of the phase transition at high-density, considering an effective theory describing the high-density heavy-quark limit of QCD. This effective theory is a simple model in which the Polyakov loop is a dynamical variable, and the quark Boltzmann factor is controlled by only one parameter, $C(μ,m_q)$, which is a function of the quark mass $m_q$ and the chemical potential $μ$. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy-quark region. As the density varies from $μ=0$ to $μ=\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the first lattice QCD determination of the γZ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, which is important for testing the Standard Model. The study covers electron beam energies up to 155 MeV and provides an updated weak charge of the proton with reduced uncertainties, especially beneficial for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a precise test of the Standard Model through the determination of the proton's weak charge, by calculating the γZ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering using lattice QCD, which is necessary for reducing uncertainties in the weak charge measurement and supporting future experiments like the P2 experiment at Mainz.

Method: The authors used lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to calculate the γZ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, covering a range of electron beam energies up to 155 MeV. They improved the precision on the axial-vector component and provided a first-principles input for the energy dependence of the γZ box, which is essential for the P2 experiment.

Result: The calculation resulted in a reduced uncertainty for the γZ box contribution, particularly at E = 0 where the vector part vanishes, and yielded an updated weak charge of the proton, Q_W^p = 0.06987(50). The results also include the energy dependence of the γZ box, which is critical for the P2 experiment operating at 155 MeV.

Conclusion: The lattice QCD determination of the γZ box contribution has led to a more accurate value for the proton's weak charge, with significantly reduced uncertainties. This result is crucial for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz and for the precise tests of the Standard Model.

Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $γZ$ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, $\square_{γZ}$ , a key ingredient for the precise tests of the Standard Model via the proton weak charge. Our calculation covers the electron beam energies up to $E =155 MeV$. For the axial-vector component, we achieve reduced uncertainties across the entire energy range compared with phenomenological estimates. For the vector component, the uncertainties remain slightly larger after continuum extrapolation. At $E = 0$, where the vector part vanishes, we obtain $\square_{γZ}= 0.00412(9)$ , reducing the uncertainty by a factor of $2$ relative to the most precise previous determination. Incorporating this result yields an updated weak charge of $Q_{W}^{p}= 0.06987(50)$ . The calculated energy dependence of $\square_{γZ}$ further provides a first-principles input for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz, which will operate at the optimized beam energy of $155 MeV$ to extract $Q_{W}^p$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately determine the properties of heavy hadrons containing bottom quarks, which is crucial for understanding the strong force and testing the Standard Model of particle physics.

Method: The researchers use MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. They employ the NRQCD action for bottom quarks, anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter quarks, constructing a variety of heavy hadron operators.

Result: The method allows for a detailed analysis of the mass spectra and mass differences of heavy hadrons, including those with multiple bottom quarks, by incorporating different types of valence quarks and considering various quantum numbers.

Conclusion: The combination of advanced lattice actions and the use of multiple lattice spacings provide a robust framework for the precise calculation of heavy hadron masses and their differences, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamics within these particles.

Abstract: We study the mass spectra and various mass differences of heavy hadrons containing one or more bottom quarks using MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. For the valence quarks, we employ a combination of lattice actions: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and the $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter (up/down) quarks. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks corresponding to various quantum numbers.
