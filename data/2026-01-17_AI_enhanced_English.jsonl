Explicit expressions are given for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the square plaquette chain and the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Our formalism can be easily extended to the minimally truncated general SU($N_c$) gauge theory. The addition of (static) quarks is discussed. We present results for the energy spectrum of the gauge field on these lattices by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and analyze its statistical properties. We also compute the SU(3) string tension and discuss how it is modified by vacuum fluctuations. Finally, we calculate the potential energies of a static quark-antiquark pair and three static quarks and study their screening at finite temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores SU(3) gauge theory on small lattices with a minimal electric field truncation, providing the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian and extending to general SU(Nc) cases. It includes exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for energy spectra, computation of the SU(3) string tension, and potential energies of static quark configurations at finite temperature.", "motivation": "The motivation is to study the SU(3) gauge theory within a simplified model by truncating the electric field to its minimal content, which allows for an analytical treatment of the theory while retaining essential features. The work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the gauge field's statistical properties and the effects of vacuum fluctuations on the string tension, as well as the behavior of quark-antiquark and three-quark systems under screening at finite temperatures.", "method": "The method involves constructing the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for specific lattice geometries (square plaquette chain and honeycomb lattice) with a restricted set of link variables. The researchers then use exact diagonalization techniques to compute the energy spectrum and analyze its statistical properties. They also calculate the SU(3) string tension and investigate modifications due to vacuum fluctuations. Additionally, they examine the potential energies of static quark-antiquark pairs and three-quark systems, and their screening at non-zero temperatures.", "result": "The results include the explicit form of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian for the specified lattices, the energy spectrum obtained from the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, the computed SU(3) string tension, and the analysis of its changes due to vacuum fluctuations. The study also provides insights into the potential energies of static quark-antiquark and three-quark systems, including the screening phenomena observed at finite temperatures.", "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper would likely summarize the findings regarding the SU(3) gauge theory in the context of the minimal electric field truncation, the statistical properties of the energy spectrum, the calculated string tension, and the behavior of quark systems. It may also discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of QCD and suggest future directions for research, such as further truncations or more complex lattice structures."}}

We apply an extended HAL QCD potential method to a baryonic system made up from a static quark and a diquark. Numerical calculations are performed by employing 2+1 flavor QCD gaugeconfigurations generated by CP-PACS and JLQCD Collaborations on a $16^{3} \\times 32$ lattice with $a^{-1} \\approx 1.6$ GeV. To improve the statistical noise in the propagators of the static quark, the HYP smearing is employed on the gauge links. Two-point correlators of quark-diquark baryonic system are then computed to obtain their ground-state energies where various types of diquarks are considered (eg: scalar diquark, axial-vector diquark etc). We apply an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system made up from a scalar diquark and a static quark to study the scalar diquark mass and the quark-diquark potential. In order to determine the diquark mass self-consistently in this HALQCD method, we demand that the baryonic spectrum in the p-wave sector obtained from the two-point correlators should be reproduced by the potential obtained from the baryonic system in the s-wave sector. We obtain the scalar diquark mass of roughly $(2/3) m_{N}$ , i.e., twice the na\u00efve estimates of a constituent quark mass together with the quark-diquark potential of Cornell type (Coulomb + linear).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper calculates the diquark mass and quark-diquark potential using an extended HAL QCD method on a baryonic system, resulting in a scalar diquark mass of approximately two-thirds of the nucleon mass with a Cornell-type quark-diquark potential.", "motivation": "The motivation is to accurately determine the diquark mass and quark-diquark potential, which are fundamental for understanding the structure and interactions within baryons, by applying an improved method that can self-consistently reproduce the baryonic spectrum.", "method": "An extended HAL QCD potential method is applied to a baryonic system consisting of a static quark and a diquark. The study uses 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations on a $16^{3} \\times 32$ lattice with HYP smearing to improve statistical noise.

This result was obtained by ensuring that the p-wave sector baryonic spectrum from the two-point correlators matched the s-wave sector potential predictions.", "conclusion": "The research successfully determined the scalar diquark mass and the form of the quark-diquark potential, providing insights into the internal dynamics of baryons. The findings support the use of the extended HAL QCD method for consistent reproduction of the baryonic spectrum."}}
