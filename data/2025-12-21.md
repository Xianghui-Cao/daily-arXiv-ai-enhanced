### [1] [Critical coupling in $φ_2^4$ theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16536)
*Stephan Durr,Tolga S. H. Kiel*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores the critical bare mass in φ^4 theory for various self-couplings, transitioning from a lattice-regularized system to an infinite volume and universal scheme. The final result is a precise value for f_c, which is 11.1097(22)tot.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the phase transition in φ^4 theory by determining the critical bare mass for different self-couplings and to find a universal parameter f_c that characterizes this transition as the coupling approaches zero.

Method: The method involves using a lattice-regularized system to determine the critical bare mass for a range of self-couplings. The data is then used to make a transition to an infinite volume and a universal scheme with renormalized parameters. A careful choice of parameterizations is made to determine f_c.

Result: The result is a precise determination of the universal parameter f_c, which is given as 11.1097(22)tot, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that they have successfully determined the value of the universal parameter f_c, which characterizes the phase transition in φ^4 theory as the self-coupling approaches zero, with a high degree of precision.

Abstract: We consider $φ^4$ theory with $φ(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ in two Euclidean dimensions. We determine for a variety of self-couplings $\hatλ$ the (negative) critical bare mass $\hatμ_{0\mathrm{c}}^2(\hatλ)$ where the lattice-regularized system changes from the symmetric to the broken phase. Based on these data, the transition to infinite volume and a universal scheme with the renormalized parameter $\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is made. Finally, $f_\mathrm{c}=\lim_{\hatλ\to0}\hatλ/\hatμ_\mathrm{c}^2(\hatλ)$ is determined, with a judicious choice of the parameterizations considered. Our final result reads $f_\mathrm{c}=11.1097(20)_\mathrm{stat}(09)_\mathrm{sys}=11.1097(22)_\mathrm{tot}$.

### [2] [Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16863)
*Thomas Appelquist,James Ingoldby,Maurizio Piai*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper uses dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) to analyze lattice data, distinguishing near-conformal but confining theories from infrared conformal ones. For SU(3) with 8 Dirac fermions, the analysis points to confinement, while for SU(2) with 1 adjoint fermion, it suggests infrared conformality.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to present a method for differentiating between gauge theories that are near-conformal and yet confining, and those that exhibit infrared conformal behavior using dilaton effective field theory (dEFT).

Method: The authors use dEFT as an analytical tool on existing sets of lattice measurements to diagnose the nature of the theories. They apply this method to two specific cases: an $SU(3)$ theory with $N_f=8$ fundamental Dirac fermions and an $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion.

Result: For the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions, the analysis indicates confinement, whereas for the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion, the fits suggest the theory exhibits infrared conformal behavior.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing potential future lattice measurements and refinements in the analysis that could further test and validate the dEFT framework for distinguishing between confining and infrared conformal gauge theories.

Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.
