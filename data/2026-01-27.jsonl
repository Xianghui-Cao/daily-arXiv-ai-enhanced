The estimator is obtained from the gradient and the Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action. It is gauge invariant, configuration-based, and independent of momentum-space information. These features enable direct checks of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this tool to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. The results confirm the proposed estimator's ability to reproduce the input temperatures across different lattice ensembles. The estimator is sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, making it a useful diagnostic for large-scale simulations."}

Invisible decays of heavy quarkonia are particularly promising for probing light dark matter, attracting broad interest due to their unique sensitivity. Experiments searching for radiative invisible decays of the $J/ψ$ have steadily improved upper limits, and upcoming facilities will push sensitivity further -- making the precise determination and subtraction of the neutrino background indispensable. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the Standard Model decay $J/ψ\\to γν\\barν$, an irreducible background to $J/ψ\\to γ+ \\textrm{invisible}$. Our result for the branching fraction is $\\operatorname{Br}(J/ψ\\to γν\\barν)=1.00(9)(7)\\times 10^{-10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is our systematic estimate. This work advances lattice-based determinations of neutrino backgrounds to quarkonium invisible decays, delivering an ab initio benchmark for $J/ψ\\to γ+ \\textrm{invisible}$. Our approach generalizes to other quarkonium channels (e.g., $Υ/φ\\to γ+\\textrm{invisible}$) and provides critical theoretical support for dark matter searches at colliders."}

Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $η^0_{s\\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\\simeq1.2$ $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields."}

M. von Hippel"], "title": "Formal Naive Dirac Operators and Graph Topology", "comment": "11 pages, uses jheppub.sty", "summary": "Motivated by a recent conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto relating the number of zero modes of lattice Dirac operators to the sum of the Betti numbers of the underlying spacetime manifold, we study formal Dirac operators on a class of graphs admitting such in terms of their zero modes. Our main result is that for graphs on which translations commute, the conjecture of Misumi and Yumoto can be shown and indeed can be strengthened to obtain bounds on the individual Betti numbers rather than merely on their sum. Interpretations of the zero modes in terms of graph quotients and of the representation theory of abelian groups are given, and connections with a homology theory for such graphs are highlighted."}
