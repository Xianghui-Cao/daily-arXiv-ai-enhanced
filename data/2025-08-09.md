Motivation: The motivation is to provide determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum and low-energy constants (quark condensate, pion decay constant, and next-to-leading-order coupling) in the context of large-N QCD, while also investigating the radial Regge trajectories and assessing the magnitude of sub-leading 1/N corrections.

Method: The method involves using large-N twisted volume reduction for numerical Monte Carlo simulations of lattice discretized theory. The study employs several values of N up to 841, multiple lattice spacings, and various quark masses to ensure reliable continuum and chiral extrapolations.

Result: The results include determinations of the meson mass spectrum and low-energy constants, as well as an investigation into the behavior of radial Regge trajectories. The research also evaluates the size of sub-leading 1/N corrections by combining infinite-N results with previous finite-N findings.

Conclusion: The conclusion would summarize the key findings on the meson mass spectrum, low-energy constants, and the behavior of radial Regge trajectories, along with the assessment of sub-leading 1/N corrections, and may discuss the implications for our understanding of large-N QCD.

Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying
meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit
$N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy
constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$,
the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling
$\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$
channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge
trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the
magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$
results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits
large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo
simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several
values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several
values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral
extrapolations.

### [2] [Gradient and Hessian-Based Temperature Estimator in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Diagnostic Tool for Stability and Consistency in Numerical Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05595)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel temperature estimator for lattice gauge theories, based on field configurations and inspired by classical statistical mechanics, is presented. It is validated in compact U(1) theories across multiple dimensions, showing accuracy and robustness, with potential for broader applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a reliable, gauge-invariant, and non-kinetic method to estimate the temperature in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and expanding the diagnostic tools available for these simulations.

Method: The method involves constructing a temperature estimator from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action of the theory, drawing inspiration from geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics. The estimator is then tested in compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in 1D, 2D, and 4D, comparing its output to the known input temperatures under varying conditions such as lattice volumes and coupling strengths.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed temperature estimator accurately reproduces the input temperatures and maintains its effectiveness over a range of simulation parameters, including different lattice sizes and coupling strengths, thus demonstrating its reliability and versatility.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this new temperature estimator, being both accurate and robust, can serve as a general-purpose tool for assessing thermodynamic consistency in lattice field theory simulations, with possible extensions to more complex scenarios like non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time diagnostics in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.

Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge
theories. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean
action of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in
classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant,
non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations
of lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge
theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated
temperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator
accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range
of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a
general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential
applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time
monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.
