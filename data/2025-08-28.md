### [1] [Finite-volume analysis and universal scaling signatures near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19337)
*Sabarnya Mitra,Frithjof Karsch*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the quantification of deviations from universal finite-size scaling behavior as a function of the light to strange quark mass ratio, using an improved order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking in QCD lattice calculations.

Motivation: The motivation is to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in QCD by performing numerical calculations on a discrete space-time lattice and to control extrapolations to the continuum, infinite-volume limits, and the limit of massless light quarks.

Method: The authors use an improved order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking that is free of additive and multiplicative divergences, and they analyze its volume and quark mass dependence at finite lattice spacings.

Result: The results show the quantified deviations from the expected universal finite-size scaling behavior when approaching the chiral limit, which are expressed as a function of the light to strange quark mass ratio.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely summarize the findings regarding the deviations from the universal behavior and their implications for understanding the chiral phase transition in QCD, but it's not explicitly stated in the abstract.

Abstract: For quantifying the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in
QCD through numerical calculations on a discrete space-time lattice, one needs
to perform controlled extrapolations to the continuum and infinite-volume
limits followed by an extrapolation to the limit of massless light quarks. We
discuss here, the results on the latter two limits at still finite lattice
spacings. We use here for chiral symmetry breaking, an improved order parameter
free of additive and multiplicative divergences and we analyse its volume and
quark mass dependence. Comparing to the expected universal behavior in the
chiral limit, we quantify deviations from the universal finite-size scaling
behavior as function of the light to strange quark mass ratio.

### [2] [Mixing of heavy and light quarks in charmonium and light mesons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19976)
*Francesco Knechtli,Jacob Finkenrath,Roman Höllwieser,Tomasz Korzec,Michael Peardon,Juan Andrés Urrea-Niño*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mixing of light mesons, charmonium, and glueballs in the flavor singlet scalar channel using lattice QCD simulations with near-physical charm quark and degenerate light quarks at two pion mass values, employing a variational basis that includes specific mesonic operators to detect and present their mixing results.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the interaction and mixing phenomena among light mesons, charmonium, and glueballs within the flavor singlet scalar channel, which is crucial for the study of hadron spectroscopy and the underlying dynamics of QCD.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations are used with an almost physical charm quark and three degenerate light quarks. The researchers use two different pion mass settings and a variational basis that incorporates mesonic operators with profiles in distillation space, Wilson loops, and two-pion operators to analyze the system and its mixing.

Result: The results show the detection and presentation of the mixing between light mesons, charmonium, and glueballs in the flavor singlet scalar channel, providing insights into the nature of these particles and their interactions under the conditions set by the simulation parameters.

Conclusion: The conclusion would likely summarize the findings on the mixing of the particles in the flavor singlet scalar channel, possibly discussing the implications for our understanding of QCD and hadron physics, and may suggest future work or the need for further investigation.

Abstract: We study the system of light mesons, charmonium and glueballs in the flavor
singlet scalar channel where they can mix. We use lattice QCD simulations with
an almost physical charm quark and three degenerate light quarks for two values
of the pion mass ($m_{\pi} \approx 420, 800$ MeV). Thanks to a variational
basis which includes mesonic operators with profiles in distillation space,
Wilson loops and two-pion operators we detect and show results of their mixing.
