Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons with single-flavor quarks, specifically those with strangeness S = -6 and charm C = 6, using lattice QCD. It employs advanced techniques to ensure reliable results and finds evidence for a bound state in the S=0 channel for the Ωccc-Ωccc system, while both systems are unbound in the S=2 channel.

Motivation: The motivation is to deepen the understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states and their binding characteristics as a function of quark masses, which can provide insights into the strong interaction dynamics within these systems.

Method: The method involves a lattice QCD study using Nf=2+1+1 MILC ensembles with HISQ sea quarks, covering four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. The researchers use valence quark propagators with a relativistic overlap action, correlation matrices with well-designed operator bases, and analyze the energy separation between dibaryon states and two-baryon thresholds.

Result: The results show a clear signal of a bound state for the Ωccc-Ωccc system in the S=0 spin channel, while the Ω-Ω system is near the threshold, making it difficult to determine its bound state status. In the S=2 channel, both systems appear to be unbound.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the study provides new insights into the binding characteristics and interaction dynamics of dibaryon states, particularly for single-flavor quarks with specific strangeness and charm, and contributes to the broader understanding of quark mass dependence in such systems.

Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of
single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$
and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC
ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four
lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators
realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices
with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state
energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their
binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy
separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon
thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor
dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the
$\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state,
while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it
difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to
be unbound.
