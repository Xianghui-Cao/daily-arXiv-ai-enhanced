In\nparticular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo\nsamples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the\nspacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the\nexact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has\ndetermined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function\ndistributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the\ndisordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions\nare found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions\nat zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon\nnumber when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In\nparticular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at\nlarge temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \\sim 2/B)$ model\ndistribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the two-point correlation functions in lattice QCD for baryon numbers 1 to 4, comparing them with theoretical distributions from simpler models like the O(N) model. It finds that O(N) model distributions accurately describe QCD distributions at zero momentum and large temporal separations, with N approximately 2/B.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of two-point correlation functions in QCD, a more complex theory, by drawing parallels with known results from simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the O(N) model, where asymptotic expressions for correlation function distributions have been established.", "method": "The method involves using importance-sampling Monte-Carlo techniques to generate empirical distributions of two-point correlation functions for various baryon numbers on a lattice. These empirical QCD distributions are then compared against the theoretical distributions from the O(N) model using statistical tests.", "result": "The result is that the O(N) model distributions match well with the empirical QCD distributions over a broad range of temporal separations, particularly when the baryon number B is considered, with N being roughly 2/B. This agreement holds true for zero-momentum conditions and large temporal separations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the O(N) model, with N approximately 2/B, provides a good approximation for the two-point correlation functions in QCD, which can be used to predict the behavior of these functions at large temporal separations."}}
