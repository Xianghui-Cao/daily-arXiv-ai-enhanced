Motivation: The motivation is to improve the precision of the form factor determinations for the $D_s \to \phi\ell \nu_\ell$ semileptonic decay, which are important for understanding the underlying physics of such decays and for testing the Standard Model.

Method: The method involves a systematic lattice QCD calculation using (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion configurations across seven gauge ensembles with varying lattice spacings and pion masses. The calculations allow for both continuum limit and physical pion mass extrapolation.

Result: The results yield form factor ratios of $r_V=1.614(19)$ and $r_2=0.741(31)$, with an overall precision of 1%-4%, representing the most precise determination to date.

Conclusion: The study concludes with significantly improved precision on the form factors for the $D_s \to \phi\ell \nu_\ell$ decay, providing a more accurate test of the Standard Model and better constraints on new physics.

Abstract: We present a systematic lattice calculation of the vector and axial vector form factors $V$ and $A_i~(i=0,1,2)$ for the $D_s \to φ\ell ν_\ell$ semileptonic decay using (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover fermion configurations generated by the CLQCD collaboration. Seven gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from $0.052~\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\text{fm}$, and different pion masses, from about $210~\text{MeV}$ to $320~\text{MeV}$ are utilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass extrapolation. The form factor ratios are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$ and $r_2=0.741(31)$. Our results of form factors reach the precision of $1\%-4\%$, which greatly improves the previous lattice QCD results and obtains the most precise determination to date.

### [2] [Lattice QCD study of color correlations between quarks in static multiquark systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21668)
*Toru T. Takahashi,Yoshiko Kanada-En'yo*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study investigates color correlations between static quarks in 3Q and 4Q multiquark systems at zero temperature using lattice QCD calculations. The color correlations are found to depend on the minimal path length of a flux tube connecting the quarks, with a universal behavior observed for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the color correlation between static quarks in multiquark systems and how it is influenced by the spatial configuration and the flux-tube path length.

Method: Quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge and standard Wilson gauge action, using a spatial volume of $L^3 = 32^3$ at $β= 5.8$, corresponding to a lattice spacing of $a=0.14$ fm. The two-body color density matrix $ρ$ was evaluated to investigate color correlations.

Result: Color correlations between quarks were found to depend on the minimal path length of the flux tube connecting them. As distance increases, color leak into the gluon field causes the color correlation to diminish, approaching a random color configuration. A universal pattern in the flux-tube path length dependence of color leak was observed across 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q ground-state systems.

Conclusion: The research concluded that there is a 'universality' in the way color correlations weaken with the increase in the flux-tube path length for different multiquark systems, which provides insight into the underlying strong interaction dynamics.

Abstract: We study the color correlation between two static quarks in 3Q ($QQQ$) and 4Q ($QQ\bar Q\bar Q$) multiquark systems at $T=0$ based on the reduced two-body density matrices $ρ$ in color space. We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $β= 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the two-body color density matrix $ρ$ of static quarks, and investigate the dependence of color correlations on the quarks' spatial configuration. As a result, we find that the color correlations depend on the minimal path length along a flux tube which connects two quarks under consideration. The color correlation between quarks quenches because of color leak into the gluon field (flux tube) and finally approaches the random color configuration in the large distance limit. We find a ``universality'' in the flux-tube path length dependence of the color leak for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q ground-state systems.

### [3] [Rotationally invariant dynamical lattice regulators for Euclidean quantum field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22072)
*Tsogtgerel Gantumur*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A dynamical-lattice regulator (DLR) for Euclidean quantum field theories is introduced, where the embedding of a hypercubic graph into real space is treated as a dynamical field. The DLR ensures exact covariance under the global Euclidean group and aims to restore symmetry through local twisting of the embedding. The paper proves Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity, discusses universality under a short-range geometry hypothesis, and demonstrates in d=4 that integrating out the embedding yields standard one-loop β-function. Preliminary 2D simulations show improved behavior over fixed lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a new lattice regularization scheme, the DLR, which maintains exact Euclidean symmetry at any lattice spacing and reduces cutoff artifacts by allowing the lattice to dynamically twist locally. This is expected to improve upon traditional fixed-lattice methods by providing a more natural way to handle geometric fluctuations and potentially leading to better numerical results in lattice field theory simulations.

Method: The method involves promoting the embedding of a hypercubic graph into a dynamical field, with the total action being local, gauge invariant, and dependent only on Euclidean invariants. The authors prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity, discuss the universality of the model under a short-range geometry hypothesis, and perform proof-of-concept Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions to demonstrate the reduction of cutoff effects.

Result: The key results include the proof of Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system, the demonstration that after integrating out the embedding, only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations are generated, and the successful implementation of a local Monte Carlo update algorithm. In 2D, the simulations show a well-behaved geometry sector and a significant reduction in axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts compared to a fixed lattice setup.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the DLR provides a promising approach for lattice field theories, maintaining exact Euclidean symmetry and showing potential for reducing lattice artifacts. The theoretical framework is supported by preliminary simulation results, indicating that the DLR could be a valuable tool for future lattice field theory studies, especially in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce a dynamical-lattice regulator (DLR) for Euclidean quantum field theories on a fixed hypercubic graph $Λ\simeq \mathbb{Z}^d$, in which the embedding $x:Λ\to \mathbb{R}^d$ is promoted to a dynamical field and integrated over subject to shape-regularity constraints. The total action is local on $Λ$, gauge invariant, and depends on $x$ only through Euclidean invariants built from edge vectors (local metrics, volumes, etc.), hence the partition function is exactly covariant under the global Euclidean group SE(d) at any lattice spacing. The intended symmetry-restoring mechanism is not rigid global zero modes but short-range *local twisting* of the embedding that mixes local orientations; accordingly, our universality discussion is conditioned on a short-range geometry hypothesis (SR): after quotienting the global SE(d) modes, connected correlators of local geometric observables have correlation length O(1) in lattice units.
  We prove Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity for the coupled system with embedding $x$ and generic gauge/matter fields $(U,Φ)$ in finite volume by treating $x$ as an additional multiplet of scalar fields on $Λ$. Assuming (SR), integrating out $x$ at fixed cutoff yields a local Symanzik effective action in which geometry fluctuations generate only SO(d)-invariant irrelevant operators and finite renormalizations; in particular, in $d=4$ we recover the standard one-loop $β$-function in a scalar $φ^4$ test theory. Finally, we describe a practical local Monte Carlo update and report $d=2$ proof-of-concept simulations showing a well-behaved geometry sector and a substantial reduction of axis-vs-diagonal cutoff artifacts relative to a fixed lattice at matched bare parameters.
