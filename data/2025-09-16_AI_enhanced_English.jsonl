The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory\nfrom the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is\ngenerally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient\nflow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The\nprimary focus is on the running coupling $\\alpha_S(\\mu)$, from which\nconfinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon\ncondensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across\ndifferent scales. Building on that, we derive $\\alpha_S(\\mu) \\simeq\n\\Lambda_S^2/\\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\\alpha_S = 0$\nin accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor\nis the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which\nis a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical\nstatements are supported by numerical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the challenge of evolving QCD theory from a perturbative to a confining regime, using gradient flow and renormalization group transformations. It focuses on the running coupling \u03b1S(\u03bc) and demonstrates that confinement can be inferred from it, with the gluon condensate being scale-invariant and leading to an infrared fixed point, indicating that homogeneous vacuum fields are key to confinement. Numerical simulations support these analytical findings.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop a method for calculating aspects of confinement in QCD, which is currently not possible analytically, and to provide a framework that could potentially prove confinement. The paper aims to bridge the gap between the perturbative and long-distance confining regimes of the theory.", "method": "The method involves the use of gradient flow and renormalization group transformations to evolve the theory. The analysis centers on the running coupling \u03b1S(\u03bc) and the role of the gluon condensate, which is shown to be scale-invariant, reflecting self-similar behavior across different scales. An analytical expression for \u03b1S(\u03bc) is derived, leading to an infrared fixed point consistent with the concept of infrared slavery.", "result": "The result is the derivation of \u03b1S(\u03bc) \u2248 \u039bS^2/\u03bc^2, which evolves to the infrared fixed point 1/\u03b1S = 0, in line with the idea of infrared slavery. This suggests that the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, such as condensates, is a critical factor for confinement, a feature shared by QCD and other models. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the scale invariance of the gluon condensate and the derived behavior of the running coupling \u03b1S(\u03bc) indicate that confinement in QCD is driven by the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields. This finding is supported by both analytical derivations and numerical simulations, suggesting a universal mechanism for confinement in QCD and similar theories."}}

This method is an extension of a previously proposed oblique decomposition technique. The performance of the new method is evaluated through three specific problems: the calculation of the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the trace of the inverse of the full Dirac operator, and the evaluation of disconnected fermion loops.", "result": "For the connected pseudoscalar correlator, the method achieves up to 30 times cost savings at large time separations, surpassing both the plain Hutchinson's estimator and the oblique formulation. In the case of the trace of the inverse of the Dirac operator, the variance reductions are less pronounced but still systematic, with greater impact on systems with poorer conditioning. However, there was no improvement observed for disconnected fermion loops, as their variance is primarily due to local same-slice contributions, which are not addressed by the new decomposition.", "conclusion": "The new multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method with orthogonal projections is effective in reducing variance and achieving cost savings for certain types of calculations in lattice QCD, such as the connected pseudoscalar correlator and the trace of the Dirac operator's inverse. It does not, however, provide benefits for disconnected fermion loops, where the variance is controlled by different factors."}}
