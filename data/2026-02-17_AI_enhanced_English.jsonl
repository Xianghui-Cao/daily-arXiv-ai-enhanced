Since the emergence of GPUs for general-purpose, mixed-precision algorithms that combine single-precision (FP32) with double-precision (FP64) arithmetics have become widely used in this field and others. While FP32-based methods are now well established, we examine the practicality of using FP16. In this work, we introduce rescaling steps in both the outer iterative refinement step and the inner BiCGStab solver to avoid numerical instability. In our experiments with a simple Wilson kernel, the solver shows improved stability, and the additional iteration count compared to the FP64 version remains within 20\\%, indicating that the FP16 version is practical for use.

Springer, Cham", "summary": "Lattice simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) enable one to calculate the low-energy properties of the strong interaction among quarks and gluons based on the first principle. The most time-consuming part of the numerical simulations of lattice QCD is typically solving a linear equation for the quark matrix. In particular, a discretized quark formulation called the domain-wall fermion operator requires a high numerical cost, while retaining the lattice version of the chiral symmetry to good precision. The domain-wall operator is defined on a five-dimensional (5D) space extending the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime with an extra fifth coordinate. After solving the linear equation in 5D space, the result vector is projected onto the original 4D space. There is a variant of the domain-wall operator that improves the convergence of the 5D linear equation while unchanging the 4D solution vector. In this paper, we examine how this variant of the domain-wall operator accelerates the iterative linear equation solver in practical setups. We also measure the eigenvalues of the operator and compare the condition number with the convergence of the solver. We use a generic lattice QCD code set Bridge++ that is planned to be released including the improved form of the domain-wall operator examined in this work with code for the GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper examines an improved variant of the domain-wall fermion operator in lattice QCD simulations, focusing on its ability to accelerate the solving of a 5D linear equation and its impact on the convergence.

As a first application, we employ $\u03ba_{AB}$ to investigate the relative strength of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry and $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry breaking in $N_f=2+1+1$ lattice QCD using optimal domain-wall fermions at the physical point. Our study covers three lattice spacings and twelve temperatures in the range 164-385~MeV. We examine three independent symmetry-breaking channels in the nonsinglet sector with connected correlators: the $U(1)_A$-sensitive scalar-pseudoscalar channel ($\u03ba_{PS}$), probing the $\u03c0$-$\u03b4$ system; the $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$-sensitive vector--axial-vector channel ($\u03ba_{VA}$), probing the $\u03c1$-$a_1$ system; and an additional $U(1)_A$-sensitive tensor--axial-tensor channel ($\u03ba_{TX}$), probing the $\u03c1$-$b_1$ system. At finite lattice spacing, we observe a clear hierarchy $\u03ba_{PS} > \u03ba_{TX} \\sim \u03ba_{VA}$. A controlled continuum extrapolation reveals that this hierarchy collapses, with all three symmetry-breaking strengths becoming statistically indistinguishable within our precision. This result provides a new, model-independent benchmark from a chirally symmetric lattice action. Our findings indicate that the effective restoration scales for $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_A$ in the nonsinglet sector converge closely near the chiral crossover, placing stringent quantitative constraints on the temperature window for chiral and axial symmetry manifestation in connected channels.
