Elhaderi", "Drishti Gupta", "Luis Hidalgo", "Andrew Lytle"], "title": "Perturbation theory, irrep truncations, and state preparation methods for quantum simulations of SU(3) lattice gauge theory", "comment": "40 pages", "summary": "We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of\n$SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the\nelectric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the\nenergy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation\ncomplexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop\nsimple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical\nsimulation on small lattices, including the $2\\times 2$ plaquette lattice in\n$d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource\nrequirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and\nintroduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on\nthe public release of \\texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building\n$SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \\texttt{pyclebsch}, a\npackage for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients."}

The computation is carried out\nby numerical simulations of the gauge theory discretized on the lattice. At\neach given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice\nspacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The\npressure and energy density are then determined by integrating the entropy\ndensity with respect to the temperature. The numerical data show a linear\nbehaviour in the strong coupling constant squared, which points to the\nStefan-Boltzmann limit at infinite temperature. They are also compatible with\nthe known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the\ncoupling constant, containing non-perturbative contributions. This\nparametrization describes well our data together with those present in the\nliterature down to 500 MeV."}

The\ncalculation relies on the evaluation of the quasi-transverse momentum-dependent\nwave function with asymmetric staple-shaped quark bilinear operators and\nfour-point meson form factors. These quantities are computed non-perturbatively\nusing two $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted-mass fermion ensembles with the same lattice\nspacing of $a=0.093$ fm: the first ensemble has a lattice size of $24^3 \\times\n48$ and a pion mass of 346 MeV; the second one has a lattice size of $32^3\n\\times 64$ and a pion mass of 261 MeV. The Collins-Soper kernel and the soft\nfunction are needed for the determination of the transverse momentum-dependent\nparton distribution functions."}
