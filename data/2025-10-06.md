TL;DR: The FASTSUM collaboration presents initial results from a new lattice QCD ensemble with high temporal resolution, focusing on chiral transition, vector-axial-vector degeneracy, and heavy quarkonium, showing comparisons to previous lower-resolution studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the understanding of strong interaction thermodynamics and spectral quantities through anisotropic lattice QCD simulations, by utilizing a finer temporal lattice spacing for improved accuracy and detail in the temporal direction.

Method: Employed an anisotropic lattice QCD approach with a new ensemble characterized by a temporal lattice spacing (a_t) of 15 am and an anisotropy (xi=a_s/a_t) of 7, enabling enhanced resolution in the temporal direction.

Result: Reported findings include the analysis of the chiral transition, the vector-axial-vector degeneracy, and the behavior of heavy quarkonium, with a comparative assessment against prior data obtained using coarser time resolutions.

Conclusion: The use of the new ensemble with higher temporal resolution provides more detailed insights into the strong interaction thermodynamics, offering improvements over earlier studies and setting a foundation for further investigations into spectral properties.

Abstract: The FASTSUM collaboration has a long-standing programme of using anisotropic
lattice QCD to investigate strong interaction thermodynamics, and in particular
spectral quantities. Here we present first results from our new ensemble which
has a temporal lattice spacing a_t=15am and anisotropy xi=a_s/a_t=7, giving
unprecedented resolution in the temporal direction. We show results for the
chiral transition, vector-axial-vector degeneracy, and heavy quarkonium, and
compare them with earlier results with coarser time resolution.

### [2] [Strong CP problem, theta term and QCD topological properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03059)
*Claudio Bonanno,Claudio Bonati,Massimo D'Elia*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This chapter discusses the $\theta$-dependence and topological properties of QCD, addressing the strong CP problem within particle physics. It compares analytical approaches with lattice simulation results to understand these aspects of QCD and similar models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and explain the $\theta$-dependence and topological characteristics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) which are responsible for the strong CP problem in the broader framework of the Standard Model of particle physics.

Method: The method involves discussing various analytical techniques that provide either qualitative or quantitative insights into the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and related models, alongside comparing these theoretical predictions with numerical data from lattice simulations.

Result: Results include a comparative analysis between different analytical methods and their validity ranges, as well as an evaluation of how well these methods' predictions align with the numerical outcomes from lattice simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of understanding the $\theta$-dependence and topological features of QCD for resolving the strong CP problem, and highlights the role of both analytical approaches and lattice simulations in advancing this knowledge.

Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological
properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise
to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of
particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to
obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the
$\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of
validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by
means of lattice simulations.

### [3] [Studying $\textrm{QED}_3$ with radial quantization on the lattice -- I. Free limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03085)
*Peter A. Boyle,Richard C. Brower,George T. Fleming,Emanuel Katz,Nobuyuki Matsumoto,Rohan Misra*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper explores 3D quantum electrodynamics on a lattice, using the overlap fermion to confirm important symmetries and correlators. It demonstrates $O(a^2)$-scaling and estimates descendant states, indicating that certain features of the theory can be studied on an icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED) in radial quantization on a lattice, specifically aiming to realize the important symmetries of the theory numerically and to understand which aspects of the theory can be effectively studied on a lattice without the need for fine-tuning.

Method: The authors construct a lattice action and study the free limit on $S^2 	imes \mathbb{R}$. They employ the overlap fermion to verify the realization of key symmetries and derive analytic correlators, which are then compared with the numerical lattice results to check consistency, including normalization. The scaling behavior toward the continuum limit and the number of descendant states are also examined.

Result: It was found that the use of the overlap fermion allowed for the numerical verification of the important symmetries, and the analytic correlators agreed with the lattice results, even with respect to overall normalization. The $O(a^2)$-scaling was confirmed as the system approached the continuum limit, and an estimate of the number of descendant states was provided for the initial refinement levels.

Conclusion: The study concludes that it is possible to investigate certain features of 3D QED on an icosahedral lattice, including the realization of important symmetries and the agreement between analytic and lattice correlators, without the requirement for fine-tuning, thus providing a basis for future research on this lattice geometry.

Abstract: To investigate the three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the radial
quantization on the lattice, the lattice action is constructed and the free
limit is studied on $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}$. With the overlap fermion, it is
numerically verified that the important symmetries of the theory can be
realized on the lattice. The analytic correlators are derived and compared to
the lattice results, which agree including the overall normalization. The
$O(a^2)$-scaling is confirmed toward the analytic value in the continuum limit,
and the number of reproduced descendant states is estimated heuristically for
the first few refinement levels. Our study helps us identify the features of
the theory that we can study on the icosahedral lattice without fine-tuning.
