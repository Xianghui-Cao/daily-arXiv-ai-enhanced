This enormous energy difference opens an interesting window into\nthe confinement of quarks and the structure of the lightest hadrons. In this\nwork, we provide the first calculation of resonance parameters of the\n$\\pi(1300)$ from lattice QCD. For this purpose, recently derived\nstate-of-the-art tools are adapted and applied both in the construction of\nthree-hadron operators and for mapping finite-volume spectra to infinite-volume\namplitudes, subsequently analytically continuing these to complex energies. For\nour heavy pion mass ensembles, we find a clear signal of the resonance. Crucial\ninput is provided through Chiral Perturbation Theory, allowing us to robustly\nextrapolate to the physical point. Applying model averaging, we extract a pole\nposition of $M_{\\pi(1300)}=(1169\\pm46)-i\\,(62_{-62}^{+168})\\,\\rm MeV$\nsupporting values from phenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
