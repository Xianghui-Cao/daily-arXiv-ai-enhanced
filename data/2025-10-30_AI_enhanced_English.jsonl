Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial\nstates remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield\nground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle,\nguide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to\nbridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting\nscalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve\ncomparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local\nnon-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo\ndata, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum\ncircuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity\nscales polynomially in system size.
