Leinweber"], "title": "Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions", "comment": "16 pages, 15 figures", "summary": "Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework\nof SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that\ndevelop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure,\nappearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear\ndisconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected\nsurface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first\ntime, these secondary loops are identified as \"connected\" or \"disconnected\"\nwith respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of\ncentre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low\ntemperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the\nsame sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small\nsecondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above\nthe phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a\nsingle large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With\nthe near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension,\nconnected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such\nas the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes\nthemselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry\nin four dimensions."}
