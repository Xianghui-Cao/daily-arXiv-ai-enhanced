This channel provides a\nclean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element\n$|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with\nphysical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise\ndetermination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including\nsecond-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and\nthe ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible\nnon-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative\nresults with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter\n$\\delta = (m_\\Lambda - m_N)/m_\\Lambda \\approx 0.16$. We find that the common\nphenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form\nfactors leads to a $\\sim 4\\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the\ncritical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for\nachieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs."}

The Landau-gauge gluon propagator $g^2 \\langle\nA_\\mu^a (s)A_\\mu^a(s') \\rangle$ is well described by the Yukawa-type function\n$e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\\equiv |s-s'|$ for $r=0.1-1.0~{\\rm fm}$ in both SU(2) and\nSU(3) QCD. Next, motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum,\nwe investigate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\\perp}(r)\n\\equiv g^2\\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \\hat \\perp)) \\rangle$ ($\\hat \\perp$: unit\nvector on the $xy$-plane), and the parallel-type one, $C_{\\parallel}(r) \\equiv\ng^2 \\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \\hat \\parallel) \\rangle$ ($\\hat \\parallel$:\nunit vector on the $tz$-plane). These two quantities reproduce all the\ncorrelation of $g^2\\langle G^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s)G^b_{\\alpha\\beta}(s')\\rangle$, due to\nthe Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries in the Landau gauge.\nCuriously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\\perp}(r)$ is\nfound to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point\ncorrelation. In contrast, the parallel-type color-magnetic correlation\n$C_{\\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region of $r \\gtrsim\n0.4~{\\rm fm}$, $C_{\\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each\nother, which leads to a significant cancellation in the sum of the\nfield-strength correlations as $\\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} g^2\\langle\nG^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s)G^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s')\\rangle \\propto C_{\\perp}(|s-s'|)+\nC_{\\parallel}(|s-s'|) \\simeq 0$. Finally, we decompose the field-strength\ncorrelation into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\\mu$\nin the Landau gauge."}
