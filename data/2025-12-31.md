### [2] [Minimal-doubling and single-Weyl Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22609)
*Tatsuhiro Misumi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic Hamiltonian formulation for minimally doubled lattice fermions in (3+1) dimensions, examining their nodal structures and symmetry patterns. It also discusses the emergence of additional Weyl nodes when a deformation parameter exceeds a critical value, suggesting that maintaining a single-Weyl phase may require parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a clear understanding of the nodal structures and symmetry patterns of minimally doubled lattice fermions, as well as to explore the conditions under which a single-Weyl phase can be maintained, especially in light of recent proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation.

Method: The authors develop a Hamiltonian formulation for both four-component Dirac and two-component Weyl constructions, classify the symmetry patterns, and introduce a species-splitting mass term to obtain single-Weyl Hamiltonians. They also construct a one-parameter family of deformations and examine the system's behavior as the parameter varies.

Result: The results show that additional Weyl nodes emerge when the deformation parameter surpasses a certain threshold, leading to the system exiting the single-node regime. This suggests that radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, and maintaining a single-Weyl phase requires 'moderate' parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the maintenance of a single-Weyl phase in interacting theories likely necessitates careful parameter control, as the system can exit the single-node regime with the introduction of additional Weyl nodes due to symmetry-allowed deformations.

Abstract: We develop a systematic Hamiltonian formulation of minimally doubled lattice fermions in (3+1) dimensions, derive their nodal structures (structures of zeros), and classify their symmetry patterns for both four-component Dirac and two-component Weyl constructions. Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires "moderate" parameter tuning.

### [3] [Precisely determining the ground state mass of Spin-3/2 $Ω_{ccc}$ baryon from Lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23417)
*Navdeep Singh Dhindsa,Debsubhra Chakraborty,Archana Radhakrishnan,Nilmani Mathur,M. Padmanath*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the most accurate determination of the ground-state masses for triply charmed baryons with both parities, using advanced computational methods and addressing all systematic uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more precise measurement of the mass of triply charmed baryons, which are particles composed of three charm quarks, by reducing the uncertainties in the calculations and using state-of-the-art lattice QCD techniques.

Method: The researchers utilized six $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles provided by the MILC collaboration. They employed two different valence charm quark actions, one being the HISQ action and the other the overlap fermion action, to perform their calculations and ensure a comprehensive analysis of systematic uncertainties.

Result: The results include the predicted masses for the lowest two triply charmed spin-3/2 baryons: $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{+}) = 4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV and $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{-}) = 5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV, with associated statistical and systematic errors.

Conclusion: The study concludes with the most precise determinations of the masses for the triply charmed baryons, providing important benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental work in particle physics.

Abstract: We present the most precise determination to date of the ground-state masses of the triply charmed baryons with both parities, obtained by continuum extrapolation and fully addressing the systematic uncertainties. The calculations are performed on six $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles, generated by the MILC collaboration, with two complementary setups for the valence charm action, one using the HISQ action and the other using the overlap fermion action. Our prediction for the mass of the lowest two triply charmed spin-3/2 baryons are: $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{+}) = 4793 (5) \left(^{+11}_{-8}\right)$ MeV, and $M_{Ω_{ccc}} (3/2^{-}) = 5094 (12) \left(^{+19}_{-17}\right)$ MeV.

### [4] [Pion scattering at finite volume within the Inverse Amplitude Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23462)
*A. Gómez Nicola,R. Molina,Julián A. Sánchez*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper studies the effect of a finite volume on pion-pion scattering using Chiral Perturbation Theory and the Inverse Amplitude Method, providing full volume dependence of two-pions scattering energy levels. The results show significant corrections for small box sizes and are consistent with lattice data, which could help in determining energy levels and phase-shifts more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy in the determination of energy levels and phase-shifts for pion-pion scattering within a finite volume, by considering the effects of the finite volume on both the unitarity right-hand cut and the left-hand one continuum contributions, as well as the $t,u$-channels and tadpole terms.

Method: The authors use Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) to calculate the pion-pion scattering in a finite volume, taking into account discretization in all channels and contributions. They extend Veltman-Pasarino identities and project onto the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations of the octahedral group to construct the IAM in this space.

Result: The study provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering and shows sizable corrections for smaller box sizes (m_πL ≲ 2). The findings are compatible with energy levels from lattice data and offer an improvement over previous analyses.

Conclusion: The analysis and results of the paper can help optimize the process of determining energy levels and phase-shifts with higher precision, especially for smaller box sizes, and contribute to the understanding of pion-pion scattering in a finite volume.

Abstract: We study the effect of a finite volume for pion-pion scattering within Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) in a $L^3$ box (rest frame). Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_πL \lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy.

### [5] [Spectral reconstruction based on dimensional reduction in high-temperature gauge theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23560)
*P. V. Buividovich,B. Hind*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new numerical spectral reconstruction workflow for high-temperature gauge theories is introduced, which integrates semi-classical real-time evolution into standard lattice QCD simulations. This approach improves the frequency resolution of spectral functions and has been validated through a (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions and light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the frequency resolution of spectral functions in high-temperature gauge theories, particularly where Euclidean-time correlators degrade at high temperatures, by incorporating semi-classical real-time evolution into the lattice QCD simulations.

Method: The method involves developing a numerical spectral reconstruction workflow that uses high-temperature dimensional reduction to integrate semi-classical real-time evolution into standard lattice QCD simulations, thus enabling better frequency resolution of spectral functions compared to methods using only Euclidean-time correlators.

Result: The proposed method accurately reproduces the full quantum spectral functions in a (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions and is successfully applied to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD, demonstrating its effectiveness in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the new workflow can estimate spectral functions with significantly better frequency resolution than traditional methods, making it a promising tool for studying high-temperature gauge theories, as evidenced by its successful application to both a simple model and lattice QCD simulations.

Abstract: We propose a numerical spectral reconstruction workflow for high-temperature gauge theories that incorporates elements of semi-classical real-time evolution directly into standard lattice QCD simulations via high-temperature dimensional reduction, thus counteracting the deterioration of Euclidean-time correlators at high temperatures. With a moderate numerical cost, our method allows to estimate spectral functions with parametrically better frequency resolution as compared with spectral reconstruction methods based on Euclidean-time correlators alone. The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime.
