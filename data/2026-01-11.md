TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method combining Lee-Yang edge detection and chiral scaling to estimate the QCD crossover line down to temperatures of about 108 MeV, with results consistent with existing data and applicable for further exploration of the QCD phase diagram.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line at low temperatures, which is important for understanding the QCD phase diagram, especially in the low-temperature, high-baryon chemical potential regime.

Method: A new method is introduced that uses the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential along with universal chiral scaling. The authors perform (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at approximately 108 MeV and purely imaginary baryon chemical potential, using a single lattice spacing and two volumes to calculate baryon-number susceptibilities and determine the Lee-Yang edge's location.

Result: The method yields the baryon chemical potential dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for temperatures greater than or equal to about 108 MeV. The results are consistent with known small-chemical potential lattice-QCD determinations and compatible with heavy-ion collision freeze-out parameters, even at low temperatures.

Conclusion: The method is validated as robust and its results are consistent with established knowledge, making it a promising approach for charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-temperature, high-baryon chemical potential region.

Abstract: We provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line down to $T\simeq108$~MeV. We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $μ_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $μ_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $μ_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\{T,μ_B\}$ and the scaling variable (\textit{i.e.}\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $μ_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$μ_B$ expansion, the resulting $μ_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $μ_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$μ_B$ regime.
