We construct Symanzik effective action for KW fermions, which is\nknown to break the hypercubic symmetry of the lattice action.

We integrate out the gauge and quark\ndegrees of freedom and rewrite the partition function as the complete trace of\na tensor network. This network consists of local tensors that contain a\nnumerical and a Grassmann part. We truncate the initial tensor at a fixed order\nin the inverse coupling $\\beta$ and compute analytical results for the\npartition function, the free energy, and the chiral condensate on a $2\\times2$\nlattice up to order $\\beta^4$.
