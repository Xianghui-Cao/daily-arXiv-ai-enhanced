### [1] [Empirical investigation of nuclear correlation function distributions in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20378)
*William Detmold,Rohan Kanchana,Cagin Yunus*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study investigates two-point correlation functions for systems with different baryon numbers using lattice QCD, and finds that the O(N) model distributions accurately describe the empirical QCD distributions at zero momentum over a broad range of temporal separations. The behavior at large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the O(N ~ 2/B) model distribution.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of two-point correlation functions in QCD, especially how they vary with spacetime separation and baryon number, and to compare these with theoretical predictions from simpler models like the O(N) model.

Method: The method involves using importance-sampling Monte-Carlo techniques on lattice QCD to generate samples of the two-point correlation functions, and then comparing the empirical distributions with those predicted by the O(N) model across various baryon numbers and spacetime separations.

Result: The results show that the O(N) model distributions provide a good match to the empirical QCD distributions at zero momentum, and that the QCD correlation function's behavior at large temporal separations is well-described by the O(N ~ 2/B) model distribution.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the O(N) model can be used as an effective theoretical framework to describe the two-point correlation functions in QCD, particularly at large temporal separations, providing a connection between the complex QCD system and simpler theoretical models.

Abstract: Two-point correlation functions of systems with baryon number $B \in
\{1,2,3,4\}$ are investigated using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In
particular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo
samples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the
spacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the
exact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has
determined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function
distributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the
disordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions
are found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions
at zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon
number when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In
particular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at
large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \sim 2/B)$ model
distribution.

### [2] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)
*Michele Caselle,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces Effective String Theory (EST) as a framework for describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory and presents a new numerical approach using deep learning to determine the width of the confining flux tube, with results for the Nambu-Goto EST.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a non-perturbative method for calculating properties of the confining flux tube in Yang-Mills theory, such as its width, which cannot be easily determined analytically within the traditional zeta-function regularization of EST.

Method: The authors introduce a novel numerical approach that utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically generative algorithms, to explore and compute the characteristics of the Effective String Theory (EST).

Result: The result of this work includes the determination of the width of the Nambu-Goto string within the context of Effective String Theory (EST) through the use of the described numerical method based on deep learning.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the application of deep learning to Effective String Theory provides a viable alternative for obtaining solutions to problems that are not amenable to analytic treatment, such as the calculation of the flux tube width.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.
