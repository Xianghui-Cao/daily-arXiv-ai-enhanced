These theories\nplay an important role in proposals for completion of the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, hence the phase transition might have occurred in the early\nstages of evolution of our universe, leaving behind a detectable relic\nstochastic background of gravitational waves. Lattice field theory studies\nimplementing the density of states method have the potential to provide\ndetailed information about the phase transition, and measure the parameters\ndetermining the gravitational-wave power spectrum, by overcoming some the\nchallenges faced with importance-sampling methods. We assess this potential for\na representative choice of Yang-Mills theory with $Sp(4)$ gauge group. We\ncharacterize its finite-temperature, first-order phase transition, in the\nthermodynamic (infinite volume) limit, for two different choices of number of\nsites in the compact time direction, hence taking the first steps towards the\ncontinuum limit extrapolation. We demonstrate the persistence of\nnon-perturbative phenomena associated to the first-order phase transition:\ncoexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, surface tension. We find\nconsistency between several different strategies for the extraction of the\nvolume-dependent critical coupling, hence assessing the size of systematic\neffects. We also determine the minimum choice of ratio between spatial and time\nextent of the lattice that allows to identify the contribution of the surface\ntension to the free energy. We observe that this ratio scales non-trivially\nwith the time extent of the lattice, and comment on the implications for future\nhigh-precision numerical studies."}
