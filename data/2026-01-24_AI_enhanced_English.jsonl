The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $\u03bc=0$ to $\u03bc=\\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes the QCD phase transition in a high-density heavy quark region using an effective theory with dynamical Polyakov loops, which is then mapped to a 3D three-state Potts model.

The phase structure is analyzed using finite volume scaling and tensor renormalization group techniques, especially in regions with a significant sign problem.", "result": "The results show that as the density increases from $\\mu=0$ to $\\mu=\\infty$, the nature of the phase transition evolves: it is first order at low densities, becomes a crossover at a critical point, and reverts to first order at high densities.", "conclusion": "The conclusion strongly suggests that there is a first-order phase transition in the high-density, heavy quark region of QCD, which is inferred from the analysis of the Potts model phase structure."}}

Classical computers generally fail to reproduce accurate results when it comes to strongly coupled theories such as QCD. Recent developments in quantum technologies open up the possibility of simulating such physical regimes by using quantum computers. In this paper, we study the quantum resource related to the simulability of a quantum theory, i.e. non-stabilizerness for Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete symmetry gauge groups. We show that enforcing gauge constraints for $\\mathbb{Z}_l$ LGTs has no cost in terms of this resource and discuss the relation between non-abelianity of the gauge group with the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge invariant Hilbert space.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs) on quantum computers, focusing on non-stabilizerness as a resource.

They investigate how imposing gauge constraints impacts this resource and examine the connection between the non-abelian property of the gauge group and the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge-invariant state space.", "result": "The results indicate that enforcing gauge constraints for Z_l Lattice Gauge Theories does not add to the non-stabilizerness, which is a positive finding for the feasibility of simulating these theories on quantum computers. Additionally, the study reveals a link between the non-abelian character of the gauge group and the non-stabilizerness of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the non-abelian nature of the gauge group has an impact on the non-stabilizerness of the gauge-invariant Hilbert space, but the imposition of gauge constraints does not contribute to the non-stabilizerness, suggesting that quantum simulation of certain Lattice Gauge Theories may be more resource-efficient than previously thought."}}

Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges.
