Using a\ncombination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$\ninvariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground\nstate wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions.\nOur method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward\ngeneralization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant\nansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke\ngauge equivariant transformations.

To assess correctness,\nwe introduce a new diagnostic based on the configurational temperature (or\nconfigurational coupling) estimator, recently proposed as a thermodynamic\nconsistency check. We compare this criterion with the established\nNagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay test across a range of couplings and\nchemical potentials. Our results show that complex Langevin dynamics yields\nreliable results in the ordered phase (large $\\beta$), but fails in the\ndisordered phase (small $\\beta$), even when the sign problem is mild. The\nconfigurational estimator provides a clear and physics-driven reliability test\nthat complements drift-based diagnostics. These findings establish the\nestimator as a practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence, and\nhighlight its potential for broader applications in lattice field theories with\ncomplex actions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines the use of complex Langevin dynamics in the 3D XY model with a finite chemical potential, introducing a new reliability test based on configurational temperature.
