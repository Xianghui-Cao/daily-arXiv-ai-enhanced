This work shows the equivalence of\ncommon spectroscopic problems to certain classes of moment problems that have\nbeen studied thoroughly in the mathematical literature. Mathematical results\ndue to Kovalishina enable rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral\nfunctions, which are implemented numerically for the first time.

In this work we study a four\ndimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has\nsecond rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on\nindividual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action\nfor the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action\nformulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a\nfunction of the gauge ($\\beta$) and matter ($\\kappa$) couplings. We compute the\nnature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and\ncompare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive\nweak coupling regime (small $\\kappa$, large $\\beta$) does not survive in the\nthermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the\nwhole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak\ncoupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected\nstrong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For\nfinite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit\nwith a first order phase transition terminating in a critical endpoint.For\n$q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic\ntopological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed\nreveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores a 4D lattice tensor gauge theory with second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields, coupled to bosonic matter. The phase diagram is mapped using Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the strong coupling confined phase dominates the entire phase diagram, with instantons preventing the weak coupling phase. For q=1, a single thermodynamic phase with a first-order transition ending at a critical point is found, while for q=2, a distinct Higgs phase consistent with the X-cube model's fractonic topological order is observed.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the behavior of higher rank gauge theories, particularly in four dimensions, by studying the phase transitions and the nature of correlators in a lattice model with tensor gauge fields and bosonic matter. The goal is to map out the phase diagram and understand how the system behaves under different couplings of the gauge and matter fields.", "method": "The authors derive the lattice action from the Hamiltonian for the gauge fields coupled to charged scalars (q=1,2). They use this action to perform Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagram as a function of the gauge (beta) and matter (kappa) couplings.

The presence of a Higgs phase for q=2 is confirmed, and the role of instantons in the destruction of the weak coupling phase is highlighted, providing insights into the behavior of 4D tensor gauge theories."}}
