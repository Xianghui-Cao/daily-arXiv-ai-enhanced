Herein, the relative scale setting for different $β$'s is discussed, using the Landau gauge gluon propagator computed with large statistical ensembles. After setting the relative scales, finite size effects are observed in the ultraviolet regime and handled in an effective description, inspired in perturbation theory. The new devised procedure is efficient in handling the finite size effects, linking the lattice simulations with continuum perturbation theory for the high momenta regime. Furthermore, the procedure can be extended to handle other Green functions computed within lattice QCD simulations."}

Code available at https://github.com/ovega14/sun_diffusion/", "summary": "Although ensemble generation remains a central challenge in lattice field theory simulations, recent advances in generative modeling may offer a path to accelerated sampling in these contexts. In this work, we implement a framework for efficiently training diffusion models acting on ${\\rm SU}(N)$ degrees of freedom, adapting the traditional score matching technique to the group manifold. We demonstrate that our models can effectively reproduce several target densities, resulting in precise unbiased expectation values. These results mark a step for diffusion models towards modeling full ${\\rm SU}(N)$ lattice field theories, including lattice Quantum Chromodynamics."}

Our method is based on the minimization of a convex loss function constructed using the Schwinger-Dyson relations. We show that score matching, a popular learning method, is a special case of our construction of an infinite family of valid loss functions. Importantly, our general Schwinger-Dyson-based construction applies to gauge theories and models with Grassmann-valued fields used to represent dynamical fermions. In particular, we extend our method to realistic lattice field theories including quantum chromodynamics."}

We investigate this approximation using the Brillouin operator as kernel, in addition to the standard Wilson Dirac operator. Numerical results show improved chiral symmetry preservation and computational efficiency compared to the Chebyshev polynomial approach."}

Under $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, we construct the charmed baryon interpolating operators and compute the corresponding hadronic matrix elements to extract the bare decay constants for each ensemble. The non-perturbative renormalization is performed via the symmetric momentum-subtraction scheme. After performing systematic chiral and continuum extrapolations, we obtain the decay constants with a precision of $8\\sim 16\\%$ from first principles."}
