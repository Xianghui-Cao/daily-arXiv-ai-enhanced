### [1] [Is it worth the effort to find Lefschetz thimbles? Integration contours with numerically optimal signal-to-noise ratios in simple fermionic toy models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07881)

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the fermionic sign problem in one-dimensional integrals, which are simplified versions of real physics models. It compares Lefschetz thimbles, holomorphic flow equation contours, and numerically optimized continuous integration contours. The study shows that for certain integrals, the sign problem can be reduced more effectively by numerical optimization than by using Lefschetz thimbles or holomorphic flow at an optimal flow-time.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and mitigate the fermionic sign problem, a computational challenge in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, by exploring various integration contour methods in simplified one-dimensional models.

Method: The authors use a comparative analysis of Lefschetz thimbles, holomorphic flow equations with different flow-times, and numerically optimized continuous integration contours. They evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing the sign problem in specific toy models, such as Hubbard-like, Gross-Neveu-like, Thirring-like, and Chern-Simons-like integrals.

Result: The results show that while Lefschetz thimbles and holomorphic flow equations can reduce the sign problem, there is an optimal flow-time where the sign problem is minimized. However, numerical optimization of continuous integration contours provides an even more effective reduction of the sign problem compared to both Lefschetz thimbles and the optimal flow-time of the holomorphic flow equation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that for the studied toy models, numerical optimization of continuous integration contours can significantly outperform Lefschetz thimbles and the optimal flow-time of the holomorphic flow equation in terms of reducing the fermionic sign problem.

Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the fermionic sign problem in a series of
one dimensional integrals, that are achieved as extreme (one-site) limits of
genuine physics models. Altogether we studied a Hubbard-like, a
Gross-Neveu-like, a Thirring-like and a Chern-Simons-like integral. We compare
the Lefschetz-thimble structure for these integrals with contours obtained with
the holomorphic flow equations at different flow-times and with numerically
optimized continuous integration contours, defined by a maximal value of the
expectation values of the phases. With the holomorphic flow equation, we
perform the large flow-time limit, so that the average phase corresponds to its
value on the thimbles. In some of these integrals (the Hubbard-, Gross-Neveu-,
and Chern-Simons-like integrals), we observe that the convergence to this value
is not monotonic, meaning that there is an optimal flow-time where the sign
problem is weaker than it is on the thimbles. Furthermore, we find that for all
of these toy models, numerical optimization can find continuous contours on
which the sign problem is considerably weaker than it is both on the thimbles
and at flowed integration contours at the optimal flow-time.
