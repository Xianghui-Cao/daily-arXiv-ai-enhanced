We\ndiscuss here, the results on the latter two limits at still finite lattice\nspacings. We use here for chiral symmetry breaking, an improved order parameter\nfree of additive and multiplicative divergences and we analyse its volume and\nquark mass dependence. Comparing to the expected universal behavior in the\nchiral limit, we quantify deviations from the universal finite-size scaling\nbehavior as function of the light to strange quark mass ratio."}

We use lattice QCD simulations with\nan almost physical charm quark and three degenerate light quarks for two values\nof the pion mass ($m_{\\pi} \\approx 420, 800$ MeV). Thanks to a variational\nbasis which includes mesonic operators with profiles in distillation space,\nWilson loops and two-pion operators we detect and show results of their mixing."}
