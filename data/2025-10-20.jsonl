We compare our results with the finite volume\nspectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512,\n2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD\ncalculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same\nphysical volume. However, we find significant differences between the two\ncalculations in the isospin $I=0$ channel. In particular, there is a nearly\nstable $\\sigma$ resonance in our lattice ChEFT calculation, which is absent in\nthe lattice QCD calculation. This likely indicates that ChEFT does not converge\nwell with a naive lattice regularization."}

The Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC) method builds a Hankel\nmatrix from the full correlator data available and truncates the eigenspectrum\nof said Hankel matrix. It proceeds by applying the Prony generalised eigenvalue\nmethod to the thus obtained low-rank approximation. A large number of algebraic\ncorrelator analysis methods including (block) Prony (and equivalently (block)\nLanczos) and the generalised eigenvalue problem (GEVP) can be reproduced as\nsub-optimal special cases of the THC method. Weights, for instance inverse\nsquare errors, can be included in the analysis, so that the result has a close\nto optimal $\\chi^2$-value. This makes the THC method very similar in spirit to\na closed form solution to multi-state fits, naturally including the case of\nmatrix-valued correlators. We show that, in general, finding approximations\nbetter than those provided by the THC method is exponentially hard in the\nnumber of exponentials. Moreover, the THC method is robust against noise and\nrequires comparably little human oversight. Finally, when applied to symmetric\ndata, the obtained energy spectrum is guaranteed to be symmetric up to machine\nprecision."}
