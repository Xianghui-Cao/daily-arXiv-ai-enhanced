Padmanath"], "title": "Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness", "comment": "15 pages, 8 tables, 10 main text figures, and 2 appendices figures", "summary": "We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of\nsingle-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\\mathcal{S} = -6$\nand charm $\\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC\nensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four\nlattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators\nrealized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices\nwith carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state\nenergy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their\nbinding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy\nseparation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon\nthresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor\ndibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the\n$\\Omega_{ccc}$-$\\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state,\nwhile the $\\Omega$-$\\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it\ndifficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to\nbe unbound.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons with single-flavor quarks, specifically those with strangeness S = -6 and charm C = 6, using lattice QCD. It employs advanced techniques to ensure reliable results and finds evidence for a bound state in the S=0 channel for the \u03a9ccc-\u03a9ccc system, while both systems are unbound in the S=2 channel.", "motivation": "The motivation is to deepen the understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states and their binding characteristics as a function of quark masses, which can provide insights into the strong interaction dynamics within these systems.", "method": "The method involves a lattice QCD study using Nf=2+1+1 MILC ensembles with HISQ sea quarks, covering four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. The researchers use valence quark propagators with a relativistic overlap action, correlation matrices with well-designed operator bases, and analyze the energy separation between dibaryon states and two-baryon thresholds.", "result": "The results show a clear signal of a bound state for the \u03a9ccc-\u03a9ccc system in the S=0 spin channel, while the \u03a9-\u03a9 system is near the threshold, making it difficult to determine its bound state status. In the S=2 channel, both systems appear to be unbound.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the study provides new insights into the binding characteristics and interaction dynamics of dibaryon states, particularly for single-flavor quarks with specific strangeness and charm, and contributes to the broader understanding of quark mass dependence in such systems."}}
