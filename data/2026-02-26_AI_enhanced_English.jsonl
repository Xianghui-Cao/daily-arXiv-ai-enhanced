Our supervised regression framework is trained on Wilson-clover ensembles with the Iwasaki gauge action, and we explore two input feature scenarios: one using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ and another relying solely on gauge observables (plaquette and rectangle), enabling a fully feature-based prediction pipeline. Using $\\text{Tr}\\, M^{-1}$ both as a physical input to cumulant construction and as a feature for predicting higher powers, we find that even with $\\sim1\\%$ labeled data, the resulting susceptibility, skewness, and kurtosis remain statistically consistent with fully measured baselines, reducing computational cost to about $26\\%$. In the feature-only approach, where correlations rather than explicit stochastic traces drive the predictions, bias correction plays a more pronounced role. We quantify this impact through multi ensemble reweighting across nearby quark masses. Our results demonstrate that bias-corrected ML estimates can significantly reduce measurement overhead while preserving the stability of higher-order observables relevant for locating the QCD critical endpoint. Code for this work is available at https://github.com/saintbenjamin/Deborah.jl .", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a bias-corrected machine learning (ML) method for estimating traces of the inverse Dirac operator, which is important for calculating higher-order cumulants of the chiral condensate near the QCD critical endpoint. The ML model, trained with Wilson-clover ensembles, can predict these traces accurately even with limited labeled data, reducing computational costs. The approach is validated using both trace-based and gauge-observable-only inputs, with the latter requiring more significant bias correction. The results show that this ML technique can significantly cut down on measurement overhead while maintaining the stability of key observables.", "motivation": "The motivation for this research is to develop an efficient method for estimating higher-order cumulants of the chiral condensate, which are crucial for pinpointing the finite-temperature QCD critical endpoint. The aim is to reduce the computational cost associated with these calculations by employing a machine learning approach.", "method": "The authors use a supervised regression framework with Wilson-clover ensembles and the Iwasaki gauge action. They explore two input scenarios: one using the trace of the inverse Dirac operator as a feature, and another relying solely on gauge observables. The ML models are trained with a small percentage of labeled data, and the predictions are compared against fully measured baselines. Bias correction is applied, and its impact is assessed through reweighting across different quark masses.", "result": "With only about 1% of the data labeled, the ML predictions for susceptibility, skewness, and kurtosis are statistically consistent with the fully measured values, leading to a reduction in computational cost to around 26%. In the case of using only gauge observables, the role of bias correction becomes more prominent, but the overall accuracy remains high, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ML approach in reducing the measurement overhead.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that the proposed bias-corrected machine learning strategy can significantly decrease the computational resources needed for estimating higher-order cumulants of the chiral condensate, without compromising the precision and stability of the observables. This method has the potential to facilitate the search for the QCD critical endpoint."}}

The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the phase structure of a single-flavor Gross-Neveu model with Wilson fermions using CTMRG, identifying different phases and critical lines through the central charge and entanglement spectrum, and finds that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime.", "motivation": "The motivation is to understand the phase structure of the single-flavor Gross-Neveu model with Wilson fermions, including the identification of the Aoki phase and its behavior in the strong-coupling regime, as well as distinguishing between topological insulator and trivial phases.", "method": "The method involves formulating the path integral as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network, contracting it approximately using the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm, and then analyzing the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and four-fermion coupling.
