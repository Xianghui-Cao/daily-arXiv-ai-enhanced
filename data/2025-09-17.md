Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A neural network wavefunction approach is introduced for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, using $SU(2)$ equivariant networks and an ansatz, achieving strong agreement with perturbative expansions and avoiding the sign problem and gauge group discretization.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories that can scale efficiently to larger systems, work in continuous group representation, and avoid the sign problem and discretization of the gauge group.

Method: The method involves using a combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks and an $SU(2)$ invariant, physics-inspired ansatz to parameterize the ground state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. The approach is benchmarked against a solely invariant ansatz by computing the ground state energy, and it evaluates the Creutz ratio and average Wilson loop.

Result: The results show strong agreement with perturbative expansions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially the need for gauge equivariant transformations. The method also provides a way to study lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension with efficient scaling to larger systems.

Conclusion: The neural network wavefunction framework offers a promising avenue for studying lattice gauge theories in higher dimensions, without the sign problem or discretization of the gauge group, and with potential generalization to $SU(N)$. It demonstrates the importance of incorporating gauge equivariant features into the model.

Abstract: We present a neural network wavefunction framework for solving non-Abelian
lattice gauge theories in a continuous group representation. Using a
combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$
invariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground
state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions.
Our method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward
generalization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant
ansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke
gauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average
Wilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative
expansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories
beyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way
that avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group.

### [2] [Configurational Temperature as a Diagnostic for Complex Langevin Dynamics in the 3D XY Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13314)
*Anosh Joseph,Arpith Kumar*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of complex Langevin dynamics in the 3D XY model with a finite chemical potential, introducing a new reliability test based on configurational temperature. This test is compared with the established drift-decay test and proves to be effective in the ordered phase but not in the disordered phase, even with a mild sign problem. The new estimator is highlighted as a practical tool for diagnosing incorrect convergence in lattice field theories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the correctness of complex Langevin dynamics in simulating systems with a sign problem, such as the 3D XY model at finite chemical potential, and to introduce a new diagnostic method that can provide a more reliable assessment of the simulation's accuracy.

Method: The authors apply complex Langevin dynamics to the 3D XY model and develop a new diagnostic test using the configurational temperature estimator. They then compare this new test with the Nagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay criterion over a range of couplings and chemical potentials.

Result: The results show that the complex Langevin dynamics are reliable in the ordered (large β) phase, but fail in the disordered (small β) phase, even when the sign problem is not severe. The configurational estimator provides a clear and physics-based test for reliability, which complements the drift-based diagnostics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the configurational temperature estimator is a valuable and practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence in simulations, and it has the potential for wider application in lattice field theories where complex actions are present.

Abstract: We investigate the applicability of complex Langevin dynamics to the
three-dimensional XY model at finite chemical potential. To assess correctness,
we introduce a new diagnostic based on the configurational temperature (or
configurational coupling) estimator, recently proposed as a thermodynamic
consistency check. We compare this criterion with the established
Nagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay test across a range of couplings and
chemical potentials. Our results show that complex Langevin dynamics yields
reliable results in the ordered phase (large $\beta$), but fails in the
disordered phase (small $\beta$), even when the sign problem is mild. The
configurational estimator provides a clear and physics-driven reliability test
that complements drift-based diagnostics. These findings establish the
estimator as a practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence, and
highlight its potential for broader applications in lattice field theories with
complex actions.
