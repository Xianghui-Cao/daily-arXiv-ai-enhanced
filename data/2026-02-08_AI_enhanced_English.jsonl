An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a quantum simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states using a QCD-inspired chiral quark model, identifying deeply bound states in the isoscalar channel with results consistent with classical predictions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore exotic multiquark states, specifically bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states, by leveraging quantum simulation as a new method that can go beyond the limitations of conventional approaches.", "method": "A 16-qubit register was used to map an effective four-quark Hamiltonian, which included color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations. A variational quantum eigensolver was then applied to identify bound and resonance states within the low-lying S-wave sector.", "result": "Deeply bound states were found in the isoscalar I(J^P)=0(1^+) channel, with a structure dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components and significant hidden-color contributions. The masses and binding energies of these states were in agreement with predictions from the classical chiral quark model.", "conclusion": "Quantum simulation has been established as a feasible approach for studying exotic multiquark states, as it successfully identified bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states with results that align with those from the classical chiral quark model, suggesting its potential for future research in this area."}}
