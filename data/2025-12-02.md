TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the confinement in discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, specifically dihedral groups $D_N$, is linked to the existence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. For odd $N$ values, where the center is trivial, static charges are screened by gluons, leading to the formation of gluelumps and string breaking without the need for particle-antiparticle pair creation. The study suggests that these simpler models can exhibit QCD-like phenomena, making them suitable for further numerical and quantum device testing.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to provide a first-principle characterization of confinement, even in simplified models, such as discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). It aims to understand how the complex physics of QCD, including charge screening and string breaking, can be observed and tested in more straightforward theoretical frameworks.

Method: The authors use a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis to explore the connection between confinement and the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup within dihedral groups $D_N$. They analyze the behavior of static charges and the mechanisms of string breaking in these models.

Result: The key finding is that when the center of the dihedral group is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming gluelumps, and string breaking can occur due to electric field fluctuations alone. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting finite-range interactions between gluelumps in the continuum limit.

Conclusion: The results indicate that the rich and intricate physics of QCD, including confinement and related phenomena, can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs. These models are proposed as ideal settings for testing QCD-like phenomenology using numerical calculations and near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit.
  Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A novel method for calculating quantum tunneling rates is introduced, employing lattice Monte Carlo simulations in imaginary time and spectral reconstruction to achieve real-time results, with validation against Schrödinger equation calculations in one-dimensional systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a non-perturbative approach on the lattice for studying false vacuum decay, addressing the challenge of obtaining real-time results and dealing with the suppression of the false vacuum state in Euclidean path integrals.

Method: The method involves lattice Monte Carlo simulations in imaginary time, construction of an implicit decay amplitude inspired by Fermi's Golden Rule, and the use of spectral reconstruction. A new sampling method is also developed to combine results from multiple Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: For a set of one-dimensional quantum systems, the tunneling rates calculated using the new method match those obtained from solving the Schrödinger equation, thus validating the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively calculates quantum tunneling rates, providing a promising tool for non-perturbative studies of false vacuum decay on the lattice, and it has been successfully tested in simple one-dimensional cases.

Abstract: We present a new method for calculating quantum tunneling rates using lattice Monte Carlo simulations in imaginary time. This method is designed with the goal of studying false vacuum decay non-perturbatively on the lattice. To get results in real time, we construct an implicit decay amplitude, inspired by Fermi's Golden Rule, and use spectral reconstruction. To deal with the suppression of the false vacuum state in the Euclidean path integral, we develop a new sampling method which combines results from multiple Monte Carlo simulations. For a simple family of one-dimensional quantum systems, we reproduce the tunneling rates calculated from the Schrodinger equation.

### [3] [Higher order net-baryon number cumulants and baryon-strangeness correlations: Comparing QCD results on thepseudo-critical line with RHIC-BES II results on the freeze-out line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01126)
*Jishnu Goswami,Frithjof Karsch*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses lattice QCD to analyze net-baryon number cumulants, comparing them with STAR measurements. It finds no evidence of a critical point within the explored range and suggests that non-interacting HRG models fail for higher baryon chemical potentials. The analysis also covers baryon-strangeness, electric-charge, and strangeness correlations, showing agreement with experimental data at high energies but deviations at lower ones, which points to the importance of considering unobserved strange resonances and feed-down corrections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to compare lattice QCD predictions for net-baryon number cumulants with experimental data from the RHIC BES-II program, in order to search for signs of a QCD critical point and to test the validity of the non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model at different baryon chemical potentials.

Method: Lattice QCD simulations are used to calculate ratios of net-baryon number cumulants, which are then compared with net-proton number cumulants measured by the STAR experiment along the pseudo-critical line. Additionally, baryon-strangeness, electric-charge, and strangeness correlations are analyzed and compared with STAR and ALICE data.

Result: The results show that there is no sign of a critical point within the explored parameter range, and the non-interacting HRG model fails for baryon chemical potentials above 1. There is consistency between lattice QCD calculations and experimental data for baryon-strangeness, electric-charge, and strangeness correlations at high beam energies, but discrepancies appear at lower energies, indicating the need for accounting for unobserved strange resonances and controlled feed-down corrections.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that a QCD critical point is unlikely to be found within the BES-II range in collider mode, and non-interacting HRG models are not sufficient for describing systems with baryon chemical potentials greater than 1. The observed deviations in baryon-strangeness correlations at lower beam energies suggest the presence of additional physics not captured by simple models, such as contributions from unobserved strange resonances.

Abstract: We present lattice QCD results for ratios of net-baryon number cumulants along the pseudo-critical line and compare them with STAR measurements from the RHIC BES-II program. The ratio of first and second order cumulants, $R_{12}^B$, agrees well with corresponding net-proton number cumulants down to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.5$ GeV or baryon chemical potentials $μ_B/T \le 2$. Likewise higher-order cumulant ratios, $R_{31}^B$ and $R_{42}^B$, show no sign for the existence of a critical point in the parameter range explored with these cumulant ratios. A QCD critical point is unlikely to occur within the BES-II range in collider mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a non-interacting HRG description breaks down for $μ_B/T > 1$. We further analyze baryon-strangeness correlations normalized by strangeness fluctuations, finding consistency with STAR data at large beam energies but deviations at lower energies. Comparisons of electric-charge and strangeness correlations with STAR and ALICE data also show agreement at high energies, while the deviations at lower energies emphasize the role of unobserved strange resonances and the need for controlled feed-down corrections in baryon-strangeness correlations.
