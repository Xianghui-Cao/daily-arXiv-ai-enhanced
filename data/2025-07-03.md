### [1] [Phases of Tree-decorated Dynamical Triangulations in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01604)
*Timothy Budd,Dániel Németh*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores an extended model of Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) in 3D, incorporating a pair of spanning trees and a middle graph. The study reveals a new phase, the triple-tree phase, alongside the known crumpled and branched polymer phases, with evidence suggesting a continuous transition between the branched polymer and triple-tree phases.

Motivation: The motivation is to revisit and expand upon the Euclidean DT approach by examining a specific subclass of 3-sphere triangulations, inspired by recent combinatorial studies, in order to uncover new insights into the non-perturbative quantum gravity and the phase structure of DT models.

Method: The method involves Monte Carlo simulations of DT decorated with a pair of spanning trees and a middle graph, which can be either a tree or have multiple components and loops. By introducing coupling constants, the researchers are able to interpolate between the restricted triple-tree class and the unrestricted tree-decorated DT, allowing for the exploration of a broader range of configurations and phase transitions.

Result: The result is the discovery of a new phase, the triple-tree phase, in addition to the well-known crumpled and branched polymer phases. The research also provides statistical analysis that suggests a continuous transition from the branched polymer to the triple-tree phase, as indicated by the behavior of the middle graph's invariants.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this work is that by extending the DT model with a pair of spanning trees and considering the properties of the middle graph, it is possible to identify a new phase of the system, which enriches our understanding of the phase structure in 3D quantum gravity models and opens up new avenues for further investigation.

Abstract: This work revisits the Euclidean Dynamical Triangulation (DT) approach to
non-perturbative quantum gravity in three dimensions. Inspired by a recent
combinatorial study by T. Budd and L. Lionni of a subclass of 3-sphere
triangulations constructed from trees, called the \emph{triple-tree} class, we
present a Monte Carlo investigation of DT decorated with a pair of spanning
trees, one spanning the vertices and the other the tetrahedra of the
triangulation. The complement of the pair of trees in the triangulation can be
viewed as a bipartite graph, called the \emph{middle graph} of the
triangulation. In the triple-tree class, the middle graph is restricted to be a
tree, and numerical simulations have displayed a qualitatively different phase
structure compared to standard DT. Relaxing this restriction, the middle graph
comes with two natural invariants, namely the number of connected components
and loops. Introducing corresponding coupling constants in the action, allows
one to interpolate between the triple-tree class and unrestricted
tree-decorated DT. Simulations of this extended model confirm the existence of
a new phase, referred to as the \emph{triple-tree phase}, besides the familiar
crumpled and branched polymer phases of DT. A statistical analysis of the phase
transitions is presented, showing hints that the branched polymer to
triple-tree phase transition is continuous.

### [2] [String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01950)
*Kaidi Xu,Umberto Borla,Sergej Moroz,Jad C. Halimeh*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper explores the dynamics of electric flux strings in a 2+1 dimensional Z_2 lattice gauge theory using tensor network methods, revealing string breaking processes and confined dynamics. The results can be tested with current quantum processors.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand string dynamics in lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with higher spatial dimensions, which is important for guiding future experiments and making connections to high-energy physics (HEP).

Method: The authors use tensor network methods to study the non-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in a 2+1D Z_2 LGT that includes dynamical matter. They calculate probabilities of the time-evolved wave function being in string configurations of the same length as the initial one.

Result: At resonances determined by the electric field strength and the mass, they observe various string breaking processes along with the creation of matter. When not at resonance, the strings show confined dynamics, which are characterized by effective perturbative models for strong electric fields. The wave function evolves into shorter strings and disconnected loops, similar to glueballs in QCD.

Conclusion: The findings on string dynamics and matter creation could be experimentally probed using state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors, providing insights relevant for both quantum computing and high-energy physics.

Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice
gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand
string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make
connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we
study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between
two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We
calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string
configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances
determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various
string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance
strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields,
we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in
maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical
regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the
latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and
trapped-ion quantum processors.
