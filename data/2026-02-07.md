### [1] [Quantum Simulation of Bound and Resonant Doubly-Bottom Tetraquark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05941)
*Ayanendu Dutta*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantum simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states using a QCD-inspired chiral quark model, identifying low-lying S-wave sector states with an effective four-quark Hamiltonian on a 16-qubit register. The results align with classical predictions, showing the potential of quantum simulation for exotic multiquark state studies.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the viability of quantum simulation as a method for studying exotic multiquark states, specifically bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states, which are beyond the reach of conventional computational methods.

Method: The authors use a QCD-inspired chiral quark model to create an effective four-quark Hamiltonian, which is then mapped onto a 16-qubit quantum register. They employ a variational quantum eigensolver to identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying S-wave sector.

Result: Deeply bound states were found only in the isoscalar I(J^P)=0(1^+) channel, primarily composed of color-singlet meson-meson components with significant hidden-color contributions. The masses and binding energies of these states are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that quantum simulation is a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states, as it can provide results consistent with those from classical models while potentially accessing states that are not feasible to compute with traditional methods.

Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.
