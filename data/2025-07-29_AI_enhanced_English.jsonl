Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist\nparameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\\ll\\kappa_c $) and\ninverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions\nstabilize the $(\\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal\ntwist satisfying $k/\\sqrt{N} < 1/9$, where the $(\\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is\nspontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also\nsuggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to\n$SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the\nadjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially\nreduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^1$ and study\nthe theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions.\nNumerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and\n$\\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with\nperiodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined)\nphase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining\ntransition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic\nadjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency\nchecks supporting these findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
