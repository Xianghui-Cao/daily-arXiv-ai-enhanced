Rothkopf", "W. A. Horowitz"], "title": "The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice", "comment": "17 pages, 17 figures", "summary": "We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian\nSU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase.\nFor the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored\nand we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical\nbox is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless\nnon-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir\npotential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size\nis fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the\nwalls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various\nmethods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating\nthe boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a\ndeconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is\nconsistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a\nboundary induced deconfined phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in SU(3) gauge theory for geometries such as parallel plates, symmetrical tubes, and boxes, revealing an attractive Casimir effect. The study also proposes methods to account for energy contributions from boundaries and shows that temperature changes do not affect the Casimir potential.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory for geometries beyond parallel plates, which has not been done before, and to understand how boundary conditions and temperature phases (confined vs. deconfined) impact the Casimir effect.", "method": "The researchers used non-perturbative methods to calculate the Casimir potential for different geometries in both (2+1)D and (3+1)D. They also proposed methods to correct for the energy associated with creating the boundaries of the geometries under investigation.", "result": "The results show that for symmetrical tubes and boxes, the Casimir effect is attractive, contrary to expectations from massless non-interacting scalar field theory. Additionally, the change in temperature from confined to deconfined phase does not modify the Casimir potential, supporting the idea of a boundary-induced deconfined phase.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory can be determined for various geometries, and it exhibits an attractive force for symmetrical tubes and boxes. The findings suggest that the Casimir potential is not influenced by the phase transition due to temperature, indicating the presence of a boundary-induced deconfined phase."}}

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called\nthe Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with\ntriad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect\nto the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy\nand other physical quantities.
