TL;DR: The paper discusses a (2+1)D QED simulation at finite density on a quantum computer, incorporating two fermion flavors and using an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz. It benchmarks the method on a small lattice system, identifies phase transitions, and uses classical simulations to optimize parameters for quantum hardware. The authors also discuss current hardware limitations and future scaling potential.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop and test a new quantum computing-based approach for simulating (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics, particularly at finite density, which could be more efficient and scalable than existing methods, with the aim of exploring complex quantum field theories that are challenging for classical computers.

Method: The method involves the use of a gauge-invariant ansatz in conjunction with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. The researchers benchmark their simulation protocol on a small lattice and use classical simulations to find optimized variational parameters, which they then apply to actual quantum hardware runs.

Result: The results include the successful identification of phase transitions based on the particle number of the fermion flavors within the simulated lattice system, as well as insights into the performance and limitations of the current quantum hardware when running these simulations.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the current hardware limitations for this type of simulation and provides a perspective on the potential for scaling up the method to larger systems, suggesting the possibility of overcoming some of the challenges faced by classical simulations of quantum field theories.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite
density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method
employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit
structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our
simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification
of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors.
Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters,
which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude
by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to
larger systems.
