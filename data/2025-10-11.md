### [1] [The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006)
*Claudio Bonanno*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations and the PTBC algorithm, which allows for more precise results. The author also verifies the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from the choice of smoothing radius and compares new results with previous literature.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a more accurate determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories by overcoming the issue of topological freezing for $N>3$ and exploring a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$.

Method: The method involves non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory and the use of the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for larger $N$ values. The study covers $3 \le N \le 6$ and takes the continuum limit at a fixed smoothing radius in physical units.

Result: The result is a precise determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to earlier studies. It also demonstrates the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from the choice of the smoothing radius in physical units.

Conclusion: The conclusion includes a comprehensive comparison of the new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit, providing a more accurate picture of the topological structure of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories.

Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$
of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte
Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and
adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to
bypass topological freezing for $N>3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to
explore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to
precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous
studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum
limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the
independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude
providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous
determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at
finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.
