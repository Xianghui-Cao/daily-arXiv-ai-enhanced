In numerical applications,\nthis strategy is spoiled by statistical noise. To circumvent the problem, we\nintroduce a low-rank approximation based on a singular-value decomposition of a\nmatrix made of the correlators. The associated bias is eliminated by an\nextrapolation to the limit of vanishing variance of energy eigenvalue. The\nstrategy is tested using a set of mock data as well as real data of $K$ and\n$D_s$ meson correlators."}
