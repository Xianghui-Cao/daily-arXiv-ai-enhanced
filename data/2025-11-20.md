Motivation: The motivation is to understand and improve the process of reconstructing Mellin moments of double parton distributions from Euclidean lattice calculations, particularly by examining the role and effect of kinematic skewness in this process.

Method: The method involves discussing the skewness dependence of hadronic correlation functions and studying its impact on the extraction of Mellin moments from lattice data through the use of several models.

Result: The results show the influence of kinematic skewness on the hadronic correlation functions and provide insights into how this dependence affects the accuracy and reliability of extracting Mellin moments of double parton distributions from lattice data.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the importance of accounting for the skewness dependence when reconstructing Mellin moments of double parton distributions from lattice calculations, as it can significantly affect the extracted moments and their interpretation.

Abstract: Reconstructing Mellin moments of double parton distributions from calculations on a Euclidean lattice requires taking an integral over a variable that may be regarded as a Ioffe time. The Fourier conjugate of this variable plays the role of a kinematic skewness in the double parton distributions. We discuss the skewness dependence of the relevant hadronic correlation functions. Using several models, we study the impact of this dependence on extracting moments of double parton distributions from existing lattice data.
