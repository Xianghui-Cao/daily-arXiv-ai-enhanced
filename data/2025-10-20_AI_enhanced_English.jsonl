We compare our results with the finite volume\nspectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512,\n2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD\ncalculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same\nphysical volume.

The Truncated Hankel Correlator (THC) method builds a Hankel\nmatrix from the full correlator data available and truncates the eigenspectrum\nof said Hankel matrix. It proceeds by applying the Prony generalised eigenvalue\nmethod to the thus obtained low-rank approximation. A large number of algebraic\ncorrelator analysis methods including (block) Prony (and equivalently (block)\nLanczos) and the generalised eigenvalue problem (GEVP) can be reproduced as\nsub-optimal special cases of the THC method. Weights, for instance inverse\nsquare errors, can be included in the analysis, so that the result has a close\nto optimal $\\chi^2$-value. This makes the THC method very similar in spirit to\na closed form solution to multi-state fits, naturally including the case of\nmatrix-valued correlators. We show that, in general, finding approximations\nbetter than those provided by the THC method is exponentially hard in the\nnumber of exponentials.
