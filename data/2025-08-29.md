### [1] [Empirical investigation of nuclear correlation function distributions in lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20378)
*William Detmold,Rohan Kanchana,Cagin Yunus*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The study uses lattice QCD to investigate two-point correlation functions for systems with baryon numbers 1-4. It compares empirical distributions from Monte-Carlo samples with theoretical O(N) model predictions, finding a good match especially at large temporal separations, with the O(N ~ 2/B) model closely reproducing the behavior of the QCD correlation function.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the empirical distributions of two-point correlation functions in QCD by comparing them with known asymptotic expressions from simpler theories, specifically the O(N) model, and to validate these expressions across different baryon numbers and spacetime separations.

Method: The method involves using importance-sampling Monte-Carlo techniques to generate samples of two-point correlation functions for baryon numbers 1-4, and then comparing the empirical distributions of these samples with theoretical distributions derived from the O(N) model, particularly focusing on the behavior at zero momentum and varying temporal separations.

Result: The results show that the theoretical O(N) model distributions accurately describe the empirical QCD correlation function distributions over a wide range of temporal separations, with the O(N ~ 2/B) model distribution providing a particularly good description of the QCD correlation function at large temporal separations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the O(N) model, with N approximately equal to 2/B, provides a valid and accurate representation of the two-point correlation functions in QCD, especially at large temporal separations, suggesting a strong correspondence between the QCD and the O(N) model predictions.

Abstract: Two-point correlation functions of systems with baryon number $B \in
\{1,2,3,4\}$ are investigated using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In
particular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo
samples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the
spacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the
exact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has
determined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function
distributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the
disordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions
are found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions
at zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon
number when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In
particular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at
large temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \sim 2/B)$ model
distribution.

### [2] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)
*Michele Caselle,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper introduces Effective String Theory (EST) as a non-perturbative framework for describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory and explores the use of deep learning to numerically determine properties like the flux tube width, presenting results for the Nambu-Goto EST width.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a method for calculating complex properties, such as the flux tube width, in Effective String Theory (EST) which cannot be easily solved analytically using traditional zeta-function regularization, by employing deep learning techniques.

Method: The authors introduce a novel numerical approach that uses deep learning and generative algorithms to explore and calculate properties within the framework of Effective String Theory (EST).

Result: The result is the determination of the width of the Nambu-Goto string within the context of Effective String Theory (EST) using the proposed numerical method based on deep learning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the application of deep learning techniques can extend the capabilities of Effective String Theory (EST) to solve problems that are too complex for analytical methods, as demonstrated by the successful calculation of the Nambu-Goto string width.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.
