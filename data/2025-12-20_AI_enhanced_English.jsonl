Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper uses dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) to analyze lattice data from gauge theories, distinguishing between near-conformal and infrared conformal behaviors. It concludes that the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions shows confinement, while the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion exhibits infrared conformal behavior.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide a diagnostic tool using dEFT to distinguish between near-conformal yet confining theories and those exhibiting infrared conformality, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of gauge theories close to the conformal window's lower edge.", "method": "The authors apply dEFT to two sets of existing lattice data: one from an $SU(3)$ theory with 8 flavors of fundamental Dirac fermions and another from an $SU(2)$ theory with a single adjoint fermion. They use dEFT to fit the lattice data and infer the nature of the theories based on these fits.", "result": "For the $SU(3)$ theory with 8 Dirac fermions, the analysis indicates confinement, while for the $SU(2)$ theory with 1 adjoint fermion, the results favor infrared conformal behavior. The study suggests that dEFT can be a useful method for diagnosing the phase of gauge theories from lattice data.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes by suggesting that further lattice measurements and refinements in the analysis could test and strengthen the framework provided by dEFT for diagnosing the phases of gauge theories."}}
