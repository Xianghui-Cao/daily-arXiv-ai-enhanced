Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation to determine the total gluon helicity contribution (ΔG) to the proton spin. The calculations are performed using three different lattice spacings and advanced techniques, including distillation, momentum smearing, and non-perturbative renormalization with CDER. After performing a continuum limit extrapolation, the results suggest that ΔG is 0.231(17)^(sta.)(33)^(sym.) at the scale μ^2=10 GeV^2, accounting for roughly 46(7)% of the proton spin.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to accurately quantify the gluon's contribution to the proton's spin, which is a fundamental question in hadronic physics. Understanding the composition of the proton's spin is crucial for comprehending the underlying structure of matter and the strong interactions described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

Method: The authors use lattice QCD simulations with three different lattice spacings, distillation plus momentum smearing for the proton external states, and a non-perturbative RI/MOM renormalization scheme with the CDER technique to calculate the bare matrix elements of the topological current K^μ and to determine its renormalization constants. They also ensure Lorentz covariance of their results and perform a continuum limit extrapolation to obtain the physical value of ΔG.

Result: The key result from the study is the determination of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, ΔG, which is found to be 0.231(17)^(sta.)(33)^(sym.) at the scale μ^2=10 GeV^2, corresponding to approximately 46(7)% of the proton spin. This value is obtained after taking into account systematic and statistical uncertainties and extrapolating to the continuum limit.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin is significant, making up about 46(7)% of the total. The findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to resolve the 'proton spin puzzle' and provide a more accurate picture of the internal dynamics within the proton as described by QCD.

Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin, $ΔG$. The calculation is done on ensembles at three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation + momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^μ$ under the 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented with the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^μ$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $ΔG$ is found to be $ΔG = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(33)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale $μ^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(7)\%$ of the proton spin.

### [2] [Implementing the three-neutron quantization condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24508)
*Wilder Schaaf,Stephen R. Sharpe*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the implementation of a three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition, including Wigner rotations and angular momenta considerations. It provides formulas, symmetries, and numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum with nearly physical parameters, suggesting that lattice QCD calculations can offer insights into two- and three-particle interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a detailed implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition, which includes handling the complexities introduced by Wigner rotations on spins and to show how lattice QCD calculations can be used to understand multi-particle interactions.

Method: The authors derive concrete formulas for cases where the angular momenta within pairs are less than 2, decompose solutions into irreducible representations, and implement a three-particle K matrix with the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. They also present numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum using nearly physical parameters and experimental-based two-particle interactions.

Result: The results include the detailed implementation of the quantization condition, the presentation of symmetries in the matrices, and the numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum. The study suggests that with sufficient precision, lattice QCD calculations can give information on both two- and three-particle interactions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the presented implementation of the three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition, along with the numerical predictions, demonstrates the potential for lattice QCD calculations to provide detailed information about multi-particle interactions, particularly in the context of three neutrons.

Abstract: We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions.

### [3] [Symmetric mass generation as a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24836)
*Sandip Maiti,Debasish Banerjee,Shailesh Chandrasekharan,Marina K. Marinkovic*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates the phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with three phases and finds evidence for second-order critical points that merge into a multicritical point, leading to a direct second-order transition between massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the phase transitions and critical phenomena in a lattice fermion model, particularly the nature of the transition between different phases, such as the massless fermion (MF) phase, the SSB phase, and the SMG phase, and to understand the conditions under which a direct transition can occur.

Method: The researchers use the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices to study the phase diagram and the critical behavior of the system. They vary the symmetry breaking parameter to observe the merging of critical points and the emergence of a multicritical point.

Result: The results show that there are traditional second-order critical points separating the MF-SSB and SSB-SMG phases. When the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, these critical points merge into a single multicritical point, enabling a direct second-order transition between the MF and SMG phases.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the merging of the critical points into a multicritical point when the symmetry breaking parameter is zero is a significant finding, as it provides evidence for a direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases, which was recently discovered.

Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of a lattice fermion model that exhibits three distinct phases: a massless fermion (MF) phase; a massive fermion phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a fermion bilinear condensate; and a massive fermion phase with symmetric mass generation (SMG). Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method on large cubical lattices, we find evidence for traditional second-order critical points separating the first two and the latter two phases. Remarkably, these critical points appear to merge at a multicritical point with enhanced symmetry when the symmetry breaking parameter is tuned to zero, giving rise to the recently discovered direct second-order transition between the massless and symmetric massive fermion phases.
