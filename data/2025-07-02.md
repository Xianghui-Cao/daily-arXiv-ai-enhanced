Abstract: I investigate a three-dimensional $U(N)$ Polyakov loop model derived that
includes the exact static determinant with $N_f$ degenerate quark flavor and
depends explicitly on the quark mass and chemical potential. In the large $N,
N_f$ limit mean field gives the exact solution, and the core of the Polyakov
loop model is reduced to a deformed unitary matrix model, which I solve
exactly. I compute the free energy, the expectation value of the Polyakov loop,
and the quark condensate. The phase diagram of the model and the type of phase
transition is investigated and shows it depends on the ratio $\kappa =N_f/N$.
