A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper addresses the fermion sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations for lattice gauge theories. It identifies Gauss law (GL) sectors that can be simulated without this problem and explores the nature of phases in these sectors, suggesting that the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, unlike the commonly considered zero-charge GL sector. The role of magnetic energy in transitions between GL sectors is also discussed.", "motivation": "To tackle the fermion sign problem which hinders the application of Monte Carlo methods in simulating lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermions, especially at low temperatures where only a few Gauss law (GL) sectors are sampled.", "method": "Analytical identification of GL sectors that avoid the fermion sign problem, followed by large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods to investigate the characteristics of the dominant GL sectors at zero temperature. The analysis includes the impact of magnetic energy on transitions between GL sectors.", "result": "Identification of specific GL sectors that can be simulated efficiently without encountering the fermion sign problem, with the finding that the vacuum states lie in staggered Gauss law sectors rather than the conventional zero-charge GL sector. The research also proves that the usual zero-charge GL sector, often regarded as the physical one, does indeed suffer from the fermion sign problem, while the ground state GL sectors do not.", "conclusion": "The findings suggest new avenues for simulating lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermions by focusing on particular GL sectors that do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, and highlight the importance of considering the magnetic energy's role in GL sector transitions."}}

A previous study using $N_\\mathrm{f}\\in[2,6]$ mass-degenerate, unimproved staggered quark flavours on $N_\u03c4\\in\\{4,6,8\\}$ lattices found that the bare mass regions displaying explicit first-order transitions shrink to zero, with their critical boundary line terminating in a tricritical point before the continuum limit is reached. Here we perform an analogous study for fixed imaginary baryon chemical potential and find the same behaviour: first-order regions observed on coarse lattices disappear in tricritical points with diminishing lattice spacing. These observations are consistent with currently available results from improved staggered discretisations, both at zero and non-zero imaginary chemical potential. Unless additional first-order transitions are found on finer lattices or with chiral lattice actions, this implies a second-order transition in the continuum chiral limit for all these cases, at zero and imaginary chemical potential. Ultimately, implications for the $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ QCD phase diagram at the physical point are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates the thermal chiral phase transition in lattice QCD and finds that first-order transitions on coarse lattices disappear at tricritical points as the lattice spacing decreases, suggesting a second-order transition in the continuum limit for various cases, including zero and imaginary chemical potential.
