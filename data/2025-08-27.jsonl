To this end, we pursue the\ngeneration of fully dynamical anisotropic HISQ (aHISQ) ensembles, aiming at a\nphysical strange quark and a heavier-than-physical light quark mass,\ncorresponding to a 300 MeV continuum pion mass. We report on tuning the gauge\nanisotropy and the lattice spacing of anisotropic pure gauge ensembles with the\ntree-level Symanzik-improved action using the gradient flow and compare various\ntuning schemes. We also discuss the simultaneous tuning of the strange quark\nmass and the quark anisotropy with aHISQ, using spectrum measurements on\nquenched ensembles. We compare different ways to tune the quark anisotropy and\ndiscuss pion taste splittings for aHISQ at anisotropies up to 8. Finally, we\npresent the expressions for the aHISQ fermion force required for dynamical\nsimulations."}
