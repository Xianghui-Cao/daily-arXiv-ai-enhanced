In this work, I present a general mechanism, motivated by meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, that identifies which excited states are enhanced by the choice of inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence and predictions from chiral perturbation theory across different hadronic channels, in particular in the nucleon sector, and provides both conceptual insight and practical guidance for controlling excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses."}

We investigate the $DDπ$ system in the $I=0$, $C=2$ sector, where the $T_{cc}^+$ appears as a pole in the $J^P = 1^+$ $DDπ$ elastic scattering amplitude. The approach automatically incorporates two-body $DD^*$ and three-body $DDπ$ effects and treats left-hand cuts due to single $π$ exchanges. Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_π\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $Dπ$ two-body subsystems. We present preliminary results for these subchannels and perform exploratory three-body spectra determinations for simple choices of the three-particle K-matrix $\\mathcal{K}_{\\text{df}, 3}$, allowing a first comparison to the lattice spectrum."}

Using lattice Non-Relativistic QCD formalism, we calculate bottom quark correlators in the gauge field ensembles generated with $N_f = 2 + 1$ flavors of dynamical staggered quarks whose dynamics include the isospin chemical potential effect and then construct $S-$ and $P-$ wave quarkonium state correlators. From these quarkonium correlators, we consider the ratios of quarkonium correlators at non-zero isospin chemical potential to that at $μ_I a = 0.000$. Here, the gauge field ensemble with $μ_I a = 0.000, 0.048, 0.053, 0.059, 0.066, 0.080, 0.092$ and $0.106$ on a $32^3 \\times 48$ lattice with non-zero isospin current strength $λa = 0.0010, 0.0018,$ and $0.0036$, where $m_π= 135$ MeV and $a = 0.1535$ fm from \\cite{Brandt:2022hwy}, are used. Preliminary results suggest that for $μ_I a = 0.106$, the Upsilon mass gets heavier than the Upsilon mass in the vacuum and that below $μ_I a = 0.106$ the isospin asymmetry effect on the Upsilon mass is not monotonic."}
