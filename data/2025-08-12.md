### [1] [Leading-Order QCD Equation of State in Strong Magnetic Fields at Nonzero Baryon Chemical Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07532)
*Heng-Tong Ding,Jin-Biao Gu,Arpith Kumar,Sheng-Tai Li*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: This paper presents results from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations for the equation of state under strong magnetic fields and nonzero baryon chemical potential, using the HISQ action. It examines the temperature and magnetic field dependence of various thermodynamic coefficients, revealing non-monotonic behavior and qualitative agreement with the hadron resonance gas model at low temperatures and weak fields, while showing deviations near the crossover and at strong fields.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a better understanding of the equation of state in QCD matter under conditions of strong magnetic fields and finite baryon density, which is relevant for astrophysical environments such as neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions.

Method: The method involves performing (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations with the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action, simulating across a range of temperatures and magnetic fields, and analyzing the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state.

Result: Results include the determination of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of several thermodynamic quantities, such as the electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios, pressure, baryon number density, and energy-like coefficients. The study finds non-monotonic behavior, temperature-band crossings, and the dominance of the pressure term over the energy contribution at high temperatures and strong fields. Additionally, the paper explores the effect of varying the electric charge to baryon number ratio, finding that charge-neutral matter shows less enhancement of the pressure coefficient despite larger absolute values of the electric charge chemical potential ratio.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the findings provide valuable input for models and effective theories of QCD matter in strong magnetic fields and at finite baryon density, with notable features such as non-monotonic structures and temperature-band crossings, and that the results are consistent with expectations from the hadron resonance gas model at low temperatures and weak fields, but deviate significantly in the crossover region and at strong fields.

Abstract: We present continuum-estimated $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD results for the
leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state in strong
magnetic fields and at nonzero baryon chemical potential. Simulations employ
the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on
lattices of temporal extent $N_\tau = 8,\,12$, covering $145 \lesssim T
\lesssim 165~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \lesssim 0.8~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing
strangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon
number ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and
$s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure
coefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\rm B}$, and
energy-like coefficients $\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\epsilon_2$ (energy
density), and $\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce
temperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in
the energy-like coefficients, with $\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly
vanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the
pressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence,
finding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field
enhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for
neutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG)
model show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear
deviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide
useful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in
strong magnetic fields at finite baryon density.

### [2] [Topological Strings in SU(3) Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07919)
*Sanatan Digal,Vinod Mamale,Sumit Shaw*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper examines the string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, which are topologically stable due to the $Z_3$ center symmetry breaking. The Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the free energy of these strings, revealing that domain walls largely influence their free energy. Near the transition point, thermal fluctuations lead to the decay of both domain walls and $Z_3$ strings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, specifically how they form at the junctions of domain walls and their stability due to the $Z_3$ center symmetry breaking. Additionally, it aims to quantify the free energy associated with these configurations and the role of domain walls in their stability, as well as the impact of thermal fluctuations near the transition point.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function on lattices with specific dimensions (spatial: $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, temporal: $N_	au=2$) are employed to compute the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings, taking into account the influence of domain walls and the effect of thermal fluctuations near the transition point.

Result: The results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is primarily determined by the domain walls. It is also found that near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the decay of both the domain walls and the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined interfaces.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the topological stability of $Z_3-$strings is closely tied to the presence of domain walls and that thermal fluctuations play a significant role in the decay of these structures near the deconfinement transition, leading to the formation of confined-deconfined interfaces.

Abstract: We investigate string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge
theory, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_3$ center symmetry.
These configurations form at the junctions of domain walls of the theory. The
complex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\pi$ on large
spatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the
Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy
associated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices
with spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\tau=2$.
Our results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the
domain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the
decay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined
interfaces.
