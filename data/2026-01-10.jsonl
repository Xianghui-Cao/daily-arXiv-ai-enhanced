We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $μ_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $μ_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\\!+\\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $μ_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $μ_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\\{T,μ_B\\}$ and the scaling variable (\\textit{i.e.}\\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $μ_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$μ_B$ expansion, the resulting $μ_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $μ_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$μ_B$ regime."}
