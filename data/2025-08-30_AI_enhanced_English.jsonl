In\nparticular, the empirical distributions of importance-sampling Monte-Carlo\nsamples of these correlation functions are examined as a function of the\nspacetime separation between the two points and the baryon number. While the\nexact forms of these distributions are not known for QCD, recent work has\ndetermined asymptotic expressions for analogous correlation function\ndistributions in simpler theories such as scalar field theory and the\ndisordered phase of the $O(N)$ model. The theoretical O(N) model distributions\nare found to provide an accurate description of the empirical QCD distributions\nat zero momentum over a wide range of temporal separations for each baryon\nnumber when assessed with a range of different statistical tests. In\nparticular, the behaviour of the baryon number $B$ QCD correlation function at\nlarge temporal separation is well-reproduced by the $O(N \\sim 2/B)$ model\ndistribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates two-point correlation functions for systems with different baryon numbers using lattice QCD, and finds that the O(N) model distributions accurately describe the empirical QCD distributions at zero momentum over a broad range of temporal separations.
