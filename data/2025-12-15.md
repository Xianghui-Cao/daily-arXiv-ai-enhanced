*Rui Xian Siew,Shailesh Chandrasekharan,Tanmoy Bhattacharya*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a qubit-regularized SU(2) lattice gauge theory as a 1D toy model for 3D Yang-Mills theory, demonstrating its behavior in both short and long-distance regimes, and calculates the ratio of string tension to the lightest glueball mass.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simplified one-dimensional model that captures key features of the more complex three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, which is relevant for understanding quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Method: The authors use a qubit-regularized SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain, map it to the Transverse Field Ising Model, and analyze the resulting system's continuum limit and excitation spectrum.

Result: The model exhibits a short-distance regime governed by free Majorana fermions and a long-distance regime with massive excitations of the E8 quantum field theory. The authors also report a specific value for the ratio of the string tension to the lightest glueball mass, √σ/m1 = 0.1763(5).

Conclusion: The proposed 1D model effectively mimics the behavior of 3D Yang-Mills theory, providing insights into the dynamics of QCD, particularly in terms of confinement and the nature of glueballs.

Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrtσ/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $σ$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of deep generative models to calculate entanglement in quantum field theories, showing that this method outperforms standard Monte Carlo algorithms and allows for high-precision estimates of Rényi entropies in 3D. It also proposes a new approach for studying lattice defects using flow-based sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the extreme challenges in calculating entanglement within quantum field theories, where current methods like the replica trick are not sufficient for very large lattices or high-precision results.

Method: The method involves applying deep generative models as an alternative to traditional Monte Carlo techniques, alongside proposing a novel paradigm for examining lattice defects through flow-based sampling.

Result: The result is a significant improvement in the precision of estimating Rényi entropies in three-dimensional space, even for large lattices, by utilizing deep generative models over conventional Monte Carlo algorithms.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the research is that deep generative models offer a superior approach to computing entanglement measures in quantum field theories, particularly for large systems, and introduce a promising new direction for studying lattice defects.

Abstract: Entanglement calculations in quantum field theories are extremely challenging and typically rely on the replica trick, where the problem is rephrased in a study of defects. We demonstrate that the use of deep generative models drastically outperforms standard Monte Carlo algorithms. Remarkably, such a machine-learning method enables high-precision estimates of Rényi entropies in three dimensions for very large lattices. Moreover, we propose a new paradigm for studying lattice defects with flow-based sampling.

### [3] [The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11424)
*Sho Araki,Hidenori Fukaya,Tetsuya Onogi,Satoshi Yamaguchi*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant, which is valued in Z_8, and demonstrates its consistency with known continuum theory values on various non-orientable manifolds using numerical and some analytical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a lattice formulation for the ABK invariant, which is more complex than the standard Z-valued index, as it appears in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on 2D non-orientable manifolds, and requires regularization due to an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues.

Method: The method involves using the massive Wilson Dirac operator, both with and without domain-walls, on 2D square lattices. The Pfaffian of this operator is used to define the ABK invariant. Nontrivial topologies are realized through twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, supporting nontrivial Pin^- structures for Majorana fermions.

Result: The results show that the lattice formulation reproduces the expected values from continuum theory when applied to a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane, and two types of Möbius strip, as verified by numerical and partial analytical means.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed lattice formulation of the ABK invariant successfully captures the correct values on different non-orientable surfaces, providing a valuable tool for further theoretical and computational studies.

Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.

*Juan Andrés Urrea-Niño,Ryan Bignell,Ruaidhrí Campion,Sinéad M. Ryan*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents a lattice calculation study of the $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium state at finite temperature, using anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles and distillation with a wide operator basis. It discusses the challenges in handling temporal correlation functions and introduces optimal distillation profiles as an alternative to derivative-based extended operators, providing insights into the temperature dependence of the $1^{-+}$ spectral function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide new insights into the behavior of the $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium state at finite temperatures, which has not been explored before in a lattice calculation, and to understand its fate under such conditions.

Method: The method involves the use of anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles, distillation with a broad operator basis, and the application of the reconstructed correlator method. The study also takes into account the special treatment required for the constant contribution to some finite-temperature temporal correlation functions and explores the use of optimal distillation profiles.

Result: The result is a detailed analysis of the $1^{-+}$ spectral function's temperature dependence, offering a deeper understanding of the state's properties at finite temperatures and suggesting the potential use of optimal distillation profiles in future studies.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that the study successfully provides novel insights into the $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium state's behavior at finite temperature, and highlights the importance of considering the temperature effects on the spectral function, while also opening up new avenues for further research with the use of optimal distillation profiles.

Abstract: Drawing upon well established zero-temperature techniques, we present, for the first time in a lattice calculation, insight into the fate of the $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium state at finite temperature. Specifically, using anisotropic FASTSUM ensembles we employ distillation with a wide operator basis which has been extensively used at zero-temperature by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration to study the charmonium spectrum. The constant contribution to some finite-temperature temporal correlation functions requires particular care with the extended operator basis common to distillation setups and we discuss this effect. As an alternative to derivative based extended operators, we also consider the use of optimal distillation profiles at finite temperature for the first time. Finally, we remark on the temperature dependence of the $1^{-+}$ spectral function by consideration of the reconstructed correlator method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more efficient and standalone computational framework for SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory, which outperforms the existing Schwinger-boson methods in terms of speed and practicality.

Method: The authors present an infinite-dimensional matrix representation for arbitrary gauge-invariant operators at a trivalent vertex within the LSH approach. They evaluate the application of these operators on LSH basis states in closed form, demonstrating significant computational advantages over the Schwinger-boson framework. A code script is also provided to implement the derived formulas.

Result: The result is a new computational framework that allows for faster classical calculations in the LSH basis compared to the Schwinger-boson method. The companion code script supports this by implementing the derived formulas and enabling quicker progress towards Hamiltonian-based calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the establishment of a standalone LSH computational framework that surpasses the Schwinger-boson approach in efficiency, as well as the provision of a code script that facilitates further research and applications in QCD.

Abstract: This work is the second installment of a series on the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory. Here, we present the infinite-dimensional matrix representation for arbitrary gauge-invariant operators at a trivalent vertex, which results in a standalone framework for computations that supersedes the underlying Schwinger-boson framework. To that end, we evaluate in closed form the result of applying any gauge-invariant operators on the LSH basis states introduced in Part I. Classical calculations in the LSH basis run significantly faster than equivalent calculations performed using Schwinger bosons. A companion code script is provided, which implements the derived formulas and aims to facilitate rapid progress towards Hamiltonian-based calculations of quantum chromodynamics.
