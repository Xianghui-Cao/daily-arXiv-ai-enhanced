Using\nthe formalism developed in Ref.~\\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of\nsynthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is\ndemonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\\\"uscher approach, the\ntruncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final\nresult. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified\nL\\\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising\nwithin the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization\nscheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range\nexpansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new numerical algorithm for the modified L\u00fcsher zeta-function is introduced, which is robust against long-range forces and shows minimal impact from truncating higher partial waves. The paper also addresses the regularization and renormalization of this function, resolving issues with cutoff regularization, leading to natural-sized effective range expansion parameters.", "motivation": "The motivation is to improve upon the standard L\u00fcsher approach by developing a more efficient and accurate method for calculating the modified L\u00fcsher zeta-function, especially in scenarios involving long-range forces, and to address the challenges of regularization and renormalization.", "method": "The researchers utilize a formalism from a previous study to analyze synthetic data on finite-volume energy levels. They propose a new numerical algorithm that is less sensitive to the truncation of higher partial waves and introduce a renormalization scheme to handle the modified L\u00fcsher zeta-function.", "result": "The results show that the new algorithm's final result is not significantly affected by the truncation of higher partial waves, unlike the standard L\u00fcsher approach. Additionally, the proposed renormalization scheme yields effective range expansion parameters of a natural size across all partial waves, even when dealing with cutoff regularization problems.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the proposed numerical algorithm and renormalization scheme provide a more reliable and stable method for computing the modified L\u00fcsher zeta-function, particularly in the presence of long-range forces, and that it leads to physically meaningful effective range parameters."}}
