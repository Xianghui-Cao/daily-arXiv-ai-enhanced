### [1] [New high-precision $b$, $c$, and $s$ masses from pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar correlators in $n_f=4$ lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02862)
*Brian Colquhoun,Christine T. H. Davies,Daniel Hatton,G. Peter Lepage*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents an updated analysis of heavy-quark current-current correlators using lattice QCD, leading to new, highly accurate values for the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses of the $b$, $c$, and $s$ quarks. The study also includes a detailed examination of finite lattice-spacing errors and calculations for QED and isospin corrections to the $\eta_s$-meson mass.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to refine and improve the accuracy of the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses for the $b$, $c$, and $s$ quarks by extending previous lattice QCD analyses. This work aims to provide more precise values that can be used in other theoretical and experimental studies within particle physics.

Method: The method involves using gluon configurations from the MILC collaboration, incorporating vacuum polarization effects from $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks, and employing lattice spacings as fine as 0.032 fm. The analysis utilizes the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) action, which is particularly advantageous for simulating $b$-quarks even at coarse lattice spacings. Additionally, the study includes (quenched) QED corrections in the simulations.

Result: The results of the analysis yield the following $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses: $\overline{m}_b(\overline{m}_b,n_f=5) = 4.1911(62)$ GeV, $\overline{m}_c(3 \mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 0.9808(33)$ GeV, and $\overline{m}_s(3 \mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 83.34(26)$ MeV. These are among the most accurate values available. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of finite lattice-spacing errors and calculates QED and isospin corrections for the $\eta_s$-meson mass.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper is that the new values for the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses of the $b$, $c$, and $s$ quarks, obtained through an extended lattice QCD analysis with HISQ action and QED corrections, represent some of the most accurate determinations to date. The study also confirms the effectiveness of the HISQ discretization for $b$-quark simulations, even on lattices where $am_b \approx 1$. Furthermore, the calculated corrections to the $\eta_s$-meson mass contribute to the precision tuning of $s$-quark masses in future lattice simulations.

Abstract: We extend an earlier lattice QCD analysis of heavy-quark current-current
correlators to obtain new values for the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses of the
$b$, $c$, and $s$ quarks. The analysis uses gluon configurations from the MILC
collaboration with vacuum polarization contributions from $u$, $d$, $s$, and
$c$ quarks ($n_f=4$), and lattice spacings down to 0.032 fm. We find that
$\overline{m}_b(\overline{m}_b,n_f=5) = 4.1911(62)$ GeV, $\overline{m}_c(3
\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 0.9808(33)$ GeV, and $\overline{m}_s(3
\mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 83.34(26)$ MeV. These results are corrected for QED by
including (quenched) QED in the simulations. They are among the most accurate
values by any method to date. We give a detailed analysis of finite
lattice-spacing errors that shows why the HISQ discretization of the quark
action is particularly useful for $b$-quark simulations even for lattices where
$am_b\approx1$. We also calculate QED and isospin corrections to the
(fictitious) $\eta_s$-meson mass, which is used to tune $s$-quark masses in
lattice simulations.

Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD
(QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound
velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density,
especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte
Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due
to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice
studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles
calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable
finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography)
bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like
theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results
from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah,
Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related
studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential.
We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound
violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective
model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.

### [3] [New computational methods in lattice gauge theory -- quantum computation and tensor networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03126)
*Etsuko Itou*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper discusses the transition from using classical computers for Lattice QCD calculations to exploring quantum computers and the Hamiltonian formalism, with a focus on recent results in calculating hadronic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore the potential of quantum computers in performing first-principles computational methods for Lattice QCD, which traditionally has been carried out on classical computers using the Lagrangian formalism. The shift towards the Hamiltonian formalism is driven by its compatibility with quantum computing technology.

Method: The method involves the use of the Hamiltonian formalism, which is more suitable for quantum computers, to calculate hadronic properties. This approach represents a departure from the traditional Lagrangian-based methods used with classical computers.

Result: The paper presents recent findings on how to effectively employ the Hamiltonian formalism on quantum computers to compute hadronic properties, suggesting progress in this alternative computational method for Lattice QCD.

Conclusion: The conclusion of the paper would likely emphasize the promising capabilities of quantum computers when paired with the Hamiltonian formalism for Lattice QCD, indicating a new direction in the field of theoretical physics for the calculation of hadronic properties.

Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical
computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40
years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought
increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the
Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss
recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian
formalism.

Abstract: We develop a strategy for computing the $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ and
$\bar{B}_s\to\gamma\ell^+\ell^-$ decay amplitudes using lattice QCD (where
$\ell^\pm$ are charged leptons). We focus on those terms which contain complex
contributions to the amplitude, due to on-shell intermediate states propagating
between the weak operator and electromagnetic current(s). Such terms, which are
generally estimated using model calculations and represent significant
uncertainties in the phenomenological predictions for these decays, cannot be
computed using standard lattice QCD techniques. It has recently been shown that
such contributions can be computed using spectral-density methods and our
proposed strategy, which we discuss in detail, is built on this approach. The
complex contributions include the ``charming penguins" (matrix elements of the
current-current operators $O_1^{(c)}$ and $O_2^{(c)}$ defined in Eq. (6)
below), in which the charm-quark loop can propagate long distances,
particularly close to the region of charmonium resonances. They also include
the contributions from the chromomagnetic operator ($O_8$ in standard notation,
defined in Eq. (8) below). We discuss the renormalization of the ultra-violet
divergences, and in particular those which arise due to ``contact" terms, and
explain how those which appear as inverse powers of the lattice spacing can be
subtracted non-perturbatively. We apply the spectral density methods in an
instructive exploratory computation of the charming penguin diagram in $B\to
K\ell^+\ell^-$ decays in which the virtual photon is emitted from the
charm-quark loop (the diagram in Fig. 1(a) below) and discuss the prospects and
strategies for the reliable determination of the amplitudes in future dedicated
computations.
