Seven gauge ensembles with\ndifferent lattice spacings, from $0.052~\\text{fm}$ to $0.105~\\text{fm}$, and\ndifferent pion masses, from about $210~\\text{MeV}$ to $320~\\text{MeV}$ are\nutilized, enabling us to take both the continuum limit and physical pion mass\nextrapolation. The ratios of form factors are obtained to be $r_V=1.614(19)$\nand $r_2=0.741(31)$, with the precision improved by up to an order of magnitude\ncompared to previous lattice studies. The branching fractions are given as\n$\\mathcal{B}(D_s\\to\\phi e\\nu_e)=2.493(66)_{\\text{stat}}(31)_{|V_{cs}|}\\times\n10^{-2}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(D_s\\to\\phi\\mu\\nu_\\mu)=2.351(60)_{\\text{stat}}(29)_{|V_{cs}|}\\times\n10^{-2}$. The corresponding ratio of the branching fractions between the lepton\n$\\mu$ and $e$ is given by $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mu/e}=0.9432(13)$, which provides\nessential theoretical support for future high-precision experimental tests of\nthe lepton flavor universality. The CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also\nextracted to be $0.952(12)_{\\text{stat}}(23)_{\\text{PDG}}$ and\n$0.945(12)_{\\text{stat}}(24)_{\\text{PDG}}$ for the $\\mu$ and $e$ channels,\nrespectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
