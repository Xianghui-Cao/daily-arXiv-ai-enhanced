The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $\u03b2_0= 2.0$ on an $8\\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $\u03b2$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|\u0394| \\leq 0.001$ for $\u03b2\\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|\u0394| < 0.06$ across $\u03b2\\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\\sim 0.003$ for $\u03b2\\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings.

To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $\u03bc$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\\langle \u03bc\\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\\langle \u03bc\\rangle \\neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\\langle \u03bc\\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.\n  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.\n  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper provides evidence for the confinement of color due to dual superconductivity in QCD vacuum, using both old and recent numerical simulations.

The study also resolves an inconsistency regarding the lack of preferred orientation of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes.", "motivation": "The motivation is to provide evidence that the mechanism of confinement in QCD is due to the dual superconductivity of the QCD vacuum, aligning with the expectation that gauge theories can be described in terms of monopoles, and to resolve inconsistencies in the understanding of the chromo-electric field within confining flux tubes.", "method": "The method involves constructing a monopole creation operator and calculating its vacuum expectation value, which serves as a disorder parameter indicating dual superconductivity. The authors use existing lattice data of two-point gauge-invariant correlations to understand the behavior of the disorder parameter after replacing field strengths with their gauge-invariant counterparts.", "result": "The results show that the vacuum expectation value of the monopole creation operator is non-zero in the confined phase, supporting the hypothesis of dual superconductivity as the mechanism for confinement. Additionally, the study resolves the issue concerning the lack of preferred orientation of the chromo-electric field within confining flux tubes, providing a more consistent picture of the phenomenon.", "conclusion": "The conclusion is that the dual superconductivity of the QCD vacuum is supported as the mechanism for color confinement, with the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the monopole creation operator serving as evidence. The resolution of the inconsistency regarding the orientation of the chromo-electric field further strengthens the theoretical framework."}}
