To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge\ncorrelation $\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\\mu_{\\rm\nQ}/\\mu_{\\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor\nlattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line,\n$\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\\mu_{\\rm Q}/\\mu_{\\rm B})_{\\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb\ncollisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \\simeq 8M_\\pi^2$,\nrespectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables,\nwe implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the\nSTAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows\nus to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that $(\\mu_{\\rm Q}/\\mu_{\\rm B})_{\\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the\ncollision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar\ncollisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and\nprovide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields\nin heavy-ion collisions."}

The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant\namplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for\nunpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient\naccess to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the\nlattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data\nwith both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer,\nthe latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent\namplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs\n$H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of\nquasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify\nand discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs."}
