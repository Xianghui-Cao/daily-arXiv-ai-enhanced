We calculated the Taylor\nexpansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical\npotential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary\nchemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function\napproximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly\nsatisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity,\nwhich are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to\nestimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential\nplane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros\nis then fitted with ans\\\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free\nenergy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to\nestimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources\nof systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\\%$\nprobability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature\nor it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not\ndisappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We\ndiscuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics\nlattice analyses."}
