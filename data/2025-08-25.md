### [1] [Soft Theorems and Dilaton Effective Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16501)
*Roman Zwicky*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new double-soft dilaton theorem, which is model-independent and accounts for the spacetime dependence of the dilaton commutator. It also discusses gravitational form factors as a means to probe infrared conformality in field theories, and explores how QCD-like gauge theories might fit into this framework, finding that the quark bilinear satisfies the double-soft theorem. The findings are also relevant to ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories.

Motivation: The motivation is to establish a more general and robust theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of dilatons and their masses, particularly when considering the effects of spacetime on the dilation commutator. Additionally, there is an interest in using gravitational form factors to explore the infrared properties of field theories, including QCD-like theories and supersymmetric gauge theories.

Method: The authors derive a new double-soft dilaton theorem that incorporates the spacetime dependence of the dilaton commutator. They apply this theorem to constrain the scaling dimension of operators responsible for generating dilaton mass. The paper further examines the applicability of these constraints to QCD-like gauge theories and ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories, with a focus on the quark bilinear operator's scaling dimension.

Result: The result is a new double-soft dilaton theorem that enforces positivity in (pseudo)-Goldstone masses and sets a constraint on the scaling dimension of operators. It is found that the quark bilinear in QCD-like theories has a scaling dimension consistent with the derived theorem. The analysis also suggests that the extension of the results to ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories is valid.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the newly derived double-soft dilaton theorem provides a useful constraint on the scaling dimensions of operators in field theories. This theorem is applicable to both QCD-like gauge theories and ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories, suggesting a broader relevance of the findings for understanding the infrared conformality and the behavior of dilatons in various models.

Abstract: We derive a new model-independent double-soft dilaton theorem, taking into
account the spacetime dependence of the dilation commutator $[i Q_D,{\cal
O}(x)]= (\Delta_{\cal O} + x \cdot \partial){\cal O}(x)$. The procedure
restores positivity in the (pseudo)-Goldstone masses and sets the constraint
$\Delta_{\cal O} = d-2\,$ for a single operator ${\cal O}$ responsible for
generating a dilaton mass.We discuss gravitational form factors as a tool to
probe infrared conformality in field theories with particle content. In a
second part we explore to what extent QCD-like gauge theories (in the chiral
limit) could fit into this category. We find that the quark bilinear has
scaling dimension $\Delta_{\bar qq} = d-2$, therefore satisfying the
double-soft theorem. We show that some findings are realised in ${\cal N}=1$
supersymmetric gauge theories and argue that the extension below the conformal
window makes sense in that case.
