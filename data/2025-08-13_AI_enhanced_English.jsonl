By analyzing zero-momentum matrix\nelements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence\nassociated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix\nelements in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual\nself-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs\nwithin the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large\nseparations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results\ndemonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth,\ncontinuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier\ntransformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability\nof both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs,\nproviding a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
