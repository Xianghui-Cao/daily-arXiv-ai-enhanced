*H. Alharazin,J. Yu. Panteleeva,B. -D. Sun*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper successfully applies score-based diffusion models to 2D SU(2) lattice gauge theory, using a quaternion parameterization and physics-conditioned sampling. The model generates configurations at different couplings and lattice sizes with good accuracy, especially for the trained coupling range, validating the approach against exact predictions.

Motivation: The motivation is to extend the application of score-based diffusion models from U(1) to the more complex non-Abelian SU(2) gauge theories, aiming to generate valid gauge field configurations across a range of couplings and lattice sizes without retraining the model for each case.

Method: A score-based diffusion model with a quaternion parameterization is used to handle the SU(2) manifold structure. The model is trained on 20,000 Monte Carlo generated samples (with random gauge transformations) at a fixed coupling β0 = 2.0 on an 8x8 lattice. Physics-conditioned sampling and a fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions are employed to enable generation at different couplings and lattice sizes, respectively.

Result: The model accurately reproduces the average plaquette and Wilson action density, with biases within acceptable ranges for the tested couplings and lattice sizes. At the training lattice size, the model shows high precision for the coupling range [1.5, 2.5] and moderate precision for [1, 4]. For lattices with at least one dimension of size 8, the precision remains high for the coupling range [1.5, 2.5], with larger deviations observed at higher couplings.

Conclusion: Score-based diffusion models show promise as a tool for generating non-Abelian gauge field configurations, with the ability to interpolate between different couplings and extrapolate to different lattice sizes. The results encourage further research into applying these models to higher-dimensional and more complex gauge theories.

Abstract: We apply score-based diffusion models to two-dimensional SU(2) lattice pure gauge theory with the Wilson action, extending recent work on U(1) gauge theories. The SU(2) manifold structure is handled through a quaternion parameterization. The model is trained on 10,000 configurations generated via Hybrid Monte Carlo at a fixed coupling $β_0= 2.0$ on an $8\times 8$ lattice, augmented to 20,000 samples via random gauge transformations. Through physics-conditioned sampling exploiting the linear $β$-dependence of the score function, we generate configurations at different values of the coupling without retraining; through the fully convolutional U-Net architecture with periodic boundary conditions, we generate configurations on lattices of different spatial extents. We validate our approach by comparing the average plaquette and Wilson action density against exact analytical predictions. At the training lattice size ($8\times 8$), the model reproduces the exact plaquette with biases $|Δ| \leq 0.001$ for $β\in [1.5, 2.5]$ and $|Δ| < 0.06$ across $β\in [1, 4]$. For lattices sharing the training extent $L=8$ in at least one direction, biases remain below $\sim 0.003$ for $β\in [1.5, 2.5]$, with larger deviations at higher couplings. This work demonstrates that diffusion models are a promising tool for non-Abelian gauge field generation and motivates further investigation toward higher-dimensional theories.

### [2] [Colour confinement and gauge-invariant field-strength correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09610)
*Adriano Di Giacomo*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper provides evidence for the confinement of color due to dual superconductivity in QCD vacuum, using both old and recent numerical simulations. It constructs a monopole creation operator and calculates its vacuum expectation value as a disorder parameter, showing that confinement is indicated by a non-zero value in the confined phase and zero in the deconfined phase. The study also resolves an inconsistency regarding the lack of preferred orientation of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide evidence that the mechanism of confinement in QCD is due to the dual superconductivity of the QCD vacuum, aligning with the expectation that gauge theories can be described in terms of monopoles, and to resolve inconsistencies in the understanding of the chromo-electric field within confining flux tubes.

Method: The method involves constructing a monopole creation operator and calculating its vacuum expectation value, which serves as a disorder parameter indicating dual superconductivity. The authors use existing lattice data of two-point gauge-invariant correlations to understand the behavior of the disorder parameter after replacing field strengths with their gauge-invariant counterparts.

Result: The results show that the vacuum expectation value of the monopole creation operator is non-zero in the confined phase, supporting the hypothesis of dual superconductivity as the mechanism for confinement. Additionally, the study resolves the issue concerning the lack of preferred orientation of the chromo-electric field within confining flux tubes, providing a more consistent picture of the phenomenon.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the dual superconductivity of the QCD vacuum is supported as the mechanism for color confinement, with the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the monopole creation operator serving as evidence. The resolution of the inconsistency regarding the orientation of the chromo-electric field further strengthens the theoretical framework.

Abstract: In this paper we produce evidence that confinement of colour is due to dual superconductivity of $QCD$ vacuum. To do that we put together results of old numerical simulations and results of more recent investigations. The starting point is the expectation that gauge theories admit a dual description in terms of monopoles. The strategy is then to construct the creation operator $μ$ of a monopole and to compute its vacuum expectation value $\langle μ\rangle$ , the disorder parameter which indicates dual superconductivity. The Imechanism of confinement is dual superconductivity of vacuum if $\langle μ\rangle \neq 0 $ in the confined phase , and $\langle μ\rangle =0$ in the deconfined phase. Confinement has to be certified by independent methods.
  It is shown that gauge invariance requires that field strengths be replaced by gauge invariant field strengths, which are their parallel transports to infinity. The resulting disorder parameter is a sum of correlation functions of gauge invariant field strength, and its behaviour understood by use of existing lattice data of two-point gauge invariant correlations.
  As a byproduct an apparent existing inconsistency, the lack of preferred orientation in colour space of the chromo-electric field inside confining flux tubes, is resolved.

### [3] [$D\bar{D}$ interactions are weak near threshold in QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09862)
*David J. Wilson,Jozef J. Dudek,Robert G. Edwards,Christopher E. Thomas*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper investigates near-threshold D meson-antimeson scattering in S and D-waves using lattice QCD, finding no evidence for bound states or resonances between the χc0(1P) state and the Ds anti-Ds threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine the presence of resonances or bound states in near-threshold D meson-antimeson scattering, which is important for understanding the spectrum of charmonium and related hadronic states.

Method: The authors use lattice QCD to compute the S-matrix for coupled-channel ηcη - D anti-D scattering as a function of varying light-quark mass, while working under an approximation that forbids charm-annihilation and assumes two degenerate light-quark flavors with a heavier strange quark.

Result: The study finds only weakly interacting meson pairs and does not observe any bound-state or resonance singularity in the energy region between the deeply-bound χc0(1P) state and the Ds anti-Ds threshold.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that there is no evidence for bound states or resonances in the investigated energy range, contrasting with other studies that have suggested the existence of such states.

Abstract: We study near-threshold $D\bar{D}$ scattering in $S$ and $D$-wave to determine whether or not resonances or bound states are present. Working in the approximation where charm-annihilation is forbidden, with two degenerate light-quark flavors and a heavier strange quark, isospin is a good quantum number, and the only other other channel that is kinematically open is $η_cη$. Using lattice QCD we compute, as a function of varying light-quark mass, the $S$-matrix for coupled-channel $η_cη- D\bar{D}$ scattering and find only weakly interacting meson pairs. In contrast to several other studies, we find no evidence for any bound-state or resonance singularity in the energy region between the deeply-bound $χ_{c0}(1P)$ state and the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ threshold.

### [4] [Simplicity of confinement in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10088)
*Xavier Crean,Jeffrey Giansiracusa,Biagio Lucini*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: A new observable, termed 'simplicity', is introduced in the context of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory to better understand the topology of Abelian monopole current loops. Lattice Gauge Theories are used to study this observable, leading to a more accurate determination of the deconfinement temperature and suggesting a strong correlation between Abelian current loops and the confinement mechanism. This work paves the way for defining an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to introduce and investigate a novel observable, named 'simplicity', which is aimed at capturing the topological features of Abelian monopole current loops within the Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. The goal is to improve the accuracy of determining the deconfinement temperature and to gain insights into the phase structure of QCD.

Method: The method involves defining the 'simplicity' as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical analysis using Lattice Gauge Theories is then carried out to evaluate the expectation value of this simplicity, allowing for a comparison with conventional methods in terms of accuracy and computational effort.

Result: The results indicate that the new observable, 'simplicity', provides a more precise determination of the deconfinement temperature compared to traditional approaches, with a similar level of computational effort. Additionally, it is found that Abelian current loops exhibit a strong correlation with the degrees of freedom responsible for confinement in the theory.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from the study is that the 'simplicity' observable offers a promising avenue for defining an order parameter for deconfinement in QCD, potentially revealing more about the complex phase structure of the theory. It also suggests that further investigation into the relationship between Abelian monopole currents and confinement could be fruitful.

Abstract: We introduce a novel observable associated to Abelian monopole currents defined in the Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that captures the topology of the current loop. This observable, referred to as the $\textit{simplicity}$, is defined as the ratio of the zeroth over the first Betti number of the current graph for a given field configuration. A numerical study of the expectation value of the simplicity performed in the framework of Lattice Gauge Theories enables us to determine the deconfinement temperature to a higher degree of accuracy than that reached by conventional methods at a comparable computational effort. Our results suggest that Abelian current loops are strongly correlated with the degrees of freedoms of the theory that determine confinement. Our investigation opens new perspectives for the definition of an order parameter for deconfinement in Quantum Chromodynamics able to expose the potentially rich phase structure of the theory.
