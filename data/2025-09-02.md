Motivation: The need to match the precision of recent experimental results for the muon g-2, which is currently limited by the difficulty in computing long-distance QED corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization in lattice QCD+QED.

Method: Development and demonstration of a reconstruction method for exclusive finite-volume state contributions, with particular focus on pion-photon contributions, using lattice QCD+QED data at a specific lattice spacing and pion mass.

Result: Relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams were found, and the reconstruction method was successfully demonstrated with the given lattice parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising approach for achieving high-precision results for the long-distance QED contribution to hadronic vacuum polarization, which is essential for advancing the accuracy of the muon g-2 calculations.

Abstract: The long-distance contribution of QED corrections to the hadronic vacuum
polarization is particularly challenging to compute in lattice QCD+QED.
Currently, it is one of the limiting factors towards matching the precision of
the recent result by the Fermilab E989 experiment for the muon g-2. In this
work, we present a method for obtaining high-precision results for this
contribution by reconstructing exclusive finite-volume state contributions. We
find relations between the pion-photon contributions of individual diagrams and
demonstrate the reconstruction method with lattice QCD+QED data at a single
lattice spacing of $a^{-1} \approx 1.73$ GeV and $m_\pi \approx 275$ MeV.

### [2] [Lattice evidence that scalar glueballs are small](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21821)

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: The paper presents the first calculation of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) for the scalar glueball using lattice field theory, indicating a distinct gluonic structure and a smaller mass radius compared to other hadrons, which could be a key feature for experimental searches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the unique properties of the scalar glueball by calculating its gravitational form factors, which can provide insights into its gluonic structure and distinguish it from typical hadronic states. This work aims to offer a distinctive characteristic that could aid in the experimental identification of glueballs.

Method: The method employed is the use of lattice field theory within the framework of Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing to calculate the GFFs of the scalar glueball. The results are then compared with GFFs of other hadrons obtained from previous lattice calculations.

Result: The result is the determination of the mass radius of the scalar glueball at 0.263(31) fm, which is significantly smaller than that of other hadrons, suggesting a different gluonic structure. The findings support the idea that the scalar glueball has a unique signature that sets it apart from typical hadronic states.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that the scalar glueball exhibits a distinctively small mass radius and a different gluonic structure, which supports the hypothesis that it is fundamentally different from other hadrons. These characteristics may serve as a potential 'smoking-gun' for identifying glueballs in experimental searches.

Abstract: This work reports the first calculation of the gravitational form factors
(GFFs) of the scalar glueball, performed via lattice field theory in Yang-Mills
theory at a single lattice spacing. The glueball GFFs are compared with those
of other hadrons as determined in previous lattice calculations, providing
strong indications that glueballs have a different gluonic structure than
typical hadronic states. A mass radius of 0.263(31) fm is predicted, supporting
previous suggestions that the scalar glueball is significantly smaller than
other hadrons. These results point towards a potential smoking-gun
characteristic to target by experimental glueball searches.
